The imake package contains the imake utility, plus the following support
programs:

   - ccmakedep
   - mergelib
   - revpath
   - mkdirhier
   - makeg
   - cleanlinks
   - mkhtmlindex
   - xmkmf

The X Window System used imake extensively up through the X11R6.9 release,
for both full builds within the source tree and external software.
X has since moved to GNU autoconf and automake for its build system in
X11R7.0 and later releases, but still maintains imake for building existing
external software programs that have not yet converted.
