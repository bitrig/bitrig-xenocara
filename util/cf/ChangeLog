	INSTALLMINORREV = true for DragonFly.  Help DragonFly since
	the package build system knows and uses these "minor
	revisions". As discussed with DragonFly developer, Joerg
	Sonnenberger.  And I was told this is probably just an
	historic artifact from a.out versioning (but would be hard
	to change for FreeBSD because many ports pkg-plists would
	need to be changed).
