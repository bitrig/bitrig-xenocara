.SH NAME
XConsortium \- X Consortium information
.SH SYNOPSIS
Releases 6.0 through 6.3 of X Version 11 were brought to you by the
X Consortium, Inc.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware membership
corporation.  It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X Consortium.
The purpose of the X Consortium was to foster the development, evolution, and
maintenance of the X Window System, a comprehensive set of vendor-neutral,
system-architecture neutral, network-transparent windowing and user interface
standards.
.PP
The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium to
provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to support
further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and the membership
decided it was in their best interests to move the consortium out of MIT and
create an independent, stand-alone organization.  All rights to the
X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc. on January 1, 1994.
X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors on December 31, 1996.  All rights to the
X Window System have been assigned to the Open Software Foundation.
.PP
The X Consortium was financially self-supporting through membership fees.
There are no license fees associated with the use of X Window System standards
and code developed by the X Consortium.  Membership in the X Consortium was
open to any organization willing to execute a membership agreement.
.PP
The X Consortium was a highly participative body.  Members were encouraged to
actively cooperate with the staff and other members in the design and review
of proposed specifications, and in the design, coding and testing of sample
implementations of those specifications.
.PP
The X Consortium accomplished most of its work using electronic mail over the
Internet, with individual mailing lists for working groups.  Internet
electronic mail connectivity was viewed as a requirement for useful
participation in X Consortium activities.  Meetings were held as necessary,
often in conjunction with industry conferences and trade shows.
