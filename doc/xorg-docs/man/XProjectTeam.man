corporation.  It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X
Consortium.
.PP
The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium
to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to
support further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and
the membership decided it was in their best interests to move the
consortium out of MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization.
All rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium,
Inc. on January 1, 1994.  On December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc.
closed its doors and all rights to the X Window System were assigned to
The Open Group.
