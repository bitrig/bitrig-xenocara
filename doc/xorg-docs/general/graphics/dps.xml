<title>Notice of Obsolescence and Removal from X.Org Releases</title>

<para>
DPS is now obsolete.
</para>

<para>
At the time when I started this project, there was no decent rendering
interface for X11 other than DPS.
</para>

<para>
Since then, there has been a large amount of work on a simple and
clean X server extension, Xrender, which provides the basis for just
such an interface.
</para>

<para>
Rendering libraries that are being built above Xrender include Xft, a
font rendering library built on FreeType; Cairo, a geometry rendering
library that provides PostScript-like rendering primitives but with
from-the-ground support for Porter-Duff compositing (transparency);
Pango, a high-level typesetting library.
</para>

<para>
If your application uses DPS, please consider porting it to the above libraries.
See <ulink url="http://dps.sourceforge.net">the DPS extension site</ulink>
for more details
</para>

<para>
The client-side DPS software was included and built by default (except
as noted below) in the X.Org X11R6.8 release series.  The client-side
software was included, but not built unless specifically
configured by the builder, in the X.Org X11R6.9 release series.
The client-side DPS software is no longer included in X11R7.0 or
later releases.
</para>

<para>
The server-side software is not included in any X.Org release for
licensing reasons; the code is still available
from <ulink url="http://dps.sourceforge.net">the DPS extension site</ulink>;
it is not known whether it still compiles.
