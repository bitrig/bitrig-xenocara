\fBAccess control list\fP
.IN "Access control list" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
X maintains a list of hosts from which client programs can be run.
By default, 
only programs on the local host and hosts specified in an initial list read 
by the server can use the display. 
Clients on the local host can change this access control list.
Some server implementations can also implement other authorization mechanisms 
in addition to or in place of this mechanism.
The action of this mechanism can be conditional based on the authorization 
protocol name and data received by the server at connection setup.

\fBSelection\fP
.IN "Selection" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
A selection can be thought of as an indirect property with dynamic
type; that is, rather than having the property stored in the server,
it is maintained by some client (the ``owner'').
A selection is global in nature and is thought of as belonging to the user 
(although maintained by clients), rather than as being private to a particular 
window subhierarchy or a particular set of clients.
When a client asks for the contents of a selection,
it specifies a selection ``target type''.
This target type can be used to control the transmitted representation of the 
contents.
For example, 
if the selection is ``the last thing the user clicked on''
and that is currently an image, then the target type might specify
whether the contents of the image should be sent in XY format or Z format.
The target type can also be used to control the class of contents transmitted; 
for example, asking for the ``looks'' (fonts, line
spacing, indentation, and so on) of a paragraph selection rather than the
text of the paragraph.
The target type can also be used for other purposes.
The protocol does not constrain the semantics.

server reset.
Timestamp values wrap around (after about 49.7 days).
The server, given its current time is represented by timestamp T,
always interprets timestamps from clients by treating half of the
timestamp space as being earlier in time than T and half of the
timestamp space as being later in time than T.
One timestamp value (named 
.PN CurrentTime ) 
is never generated by the server.
This value is reserved for use in requests to represent the current 
server time.

\fBTrueColor\fP
.IN "TrueColor" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
.PN TrueColor
can be viewed as a degenerate case of 
.PN DirectColor
in which the subfields in the pixel value directly encode 
the corresponding RGB values; that is, the colormap has predefined 
read-only RGB values.
The values are typically linear or near-linear increasing ramps.

\fBType\fP
.IN "Type" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
A type is an arbitrary atom used to identify the interpretation of
property data.
Types are completely uninterpreted by the server
and are solely for the benefit of clients.

\fBViewable\fP
.IN "Viewable" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
A window is viewable if it and all of its ancestors are mapped.
This does not imply that any portion of the window is actually visible.
Graphics requests can be performed on a window when it is not viewable,
but output will not be retained unless the server is maintaining
backing store.

\fBVisible\fP
.IN "Visible" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
A region of a window is visible if someone looking at the screen can
actually see it; 
that is, the window is viewable and the region is not occluded by any 
other window.

When windows are resized, 
subwindows may be repositioned automatically relative to some position 
in the window.
This attraction of a subwindow to some part of its parent is known 
as window gravity.

Manipulation of windows on the screen and much of the user interface

The data for a pixmap is said to be in XY format if it is organized as
a set of bitmaps representing individual bit planes, with the planes
appearing from most-significant to least-significant in bit order.

a set of pixel values in scanline order.
