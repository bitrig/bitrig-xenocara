Post-installation instructions for X.Org on OpenBSD/vax
-------------------------------------------------------

Currently, an X server is supported on the VAXstation 4000 models
with either lcg(4) or lcspx(4) frame buffers. Other frame buffers
are not supported yet, even though some of them are supported by
the OpenBSD kernel.

Typical Xorg use on VAX machines requires no special configuration.
The provided /etc/X11/xorg.conf will work in most setups.

You can run the X server either with xdm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xdm(1), the X display manager by activating the xdm_flags option
      in /etc/rc.conf(8) or /etc/rc.conf.local(8).  You do not need to disable
      the console getty.

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.
