Post-installation instructions for X.Org on OpenBSD/loongson
------------------------------------------------------------

OpenBSD use the X.Org X server on loongson.

Currently, the X server is supported on the Lemote Yeelong and EMTEC
Gdium Liberty netbooks with a smfb(4) frame buffer. The wsfb driver
provides an unaccelerated frame buffer for use with the X server. 

No xorg.conf is needed in this configuration, unless you want to 
change default options.

To start xdm, the X display manager, activate the xdm_flags option in
/etc/rc.conf.local(8). You will need to disable the console getty in /etc/ttys.

Alternatively, you can log in at the console and run `startx'.
