Post-installation instructions for X.Org on OpenBSD/i386
--------------------------------------------------------

Conventions used in this document:
  - somename(1) implies that "somename" is a program, and there is a
    manual page available in section 1 of the manual pages for further
    reading, viewed by typing "man 1 somename".

1. Make sure your system has support for X enabled:

   You must have "option APERTURE" in your kernel configuration and
   uncomment the line that says:  

        machdep.allowaperture=1

   or

        machdep.allowaperture=2

   in /etc/sysctl.conf.  See xf86(4) for more details about security
   issues related to this.  After changing this variable in sysctl.conf,
   you will need to reboot for the change to take effect. Most drivers for
   X.Org XOrgVersion servers require this value to be set to 2, while
   drivers for XFree86 3.3.6 require it only to be set to 1.

2. Find out about your hardware:

   Find out what chipset is used by your video board.  Write this
   information down. The dmesg(8) command output is useful.

   You need to decide if you can use the X.Org XOrgVersion server,
   Xorg(1), or if you have some legacy VGA card supported only by
   one of the old XFree86 3.3.6 servers:

        XF86_3DLabs(1) XF86_Mach8(1)  XF86_S3(1)   XF86_VGA16(1)
        XF86_I128(1)   XF86_Mach32(1) XF86_S3V(1)  XF86_SVGA(1)
        XF86_8514(1)   XF86_Mach64(1) XF86_W32(1)  XF86_Mono(1)
        XF86_P9000(1)  XF86_AGX(1)

   If in doubt, try X.Org XOrgVersion first.

   What kind of mouse do you have and which port is it connected to?
   The two most common cases are a PS/2 style or USB mouse, for which
   OpenBSD uses the wsmouse(4) protocol with the /dev/wsmouse device.
   If you have a serial mouse, connected to /dev/tty00 (MS Windows
   COM1: port) or /dev/tty01 (COM2: port) you probably want to try the
   "auto" protocol first.

3. Create the configuration file for your server.

   For many users of X.Org's servers, an xorg.conf file is not needed,
   simply start X, and it will automatically detect and use your
   hardware.  If your hardware is not properly autodetected or supported
   or not supported as you wish, you will have to create a configuration
   file.

   XFree86 3.3.6 will require an /etc/XF86Config file to be generated.

   Please note the location of the configuration file listed below.
   Both the location and the utilities that generate them are different.
   You will not have great success mixing X.Org XOrgVersion xorg.conf(5)
   files with XFree86 3.3.6 XF86Config files.

    a. For the X.Org XOrgVersion server, run xorgcfg(1) or xorgconfig(1).
       - The text mode of xorgcfg(1) is recommended, by typing
         "xorgcfg -textmode".
       - This will produce the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.
       - This will create /usr/X11R6/bin/X as a link to Xorg.
       - If "xorgcfg -textmode" doesn't work on your hardware, try
         the alternate program, xorgconfig(1).
       - if neither of these alternatives produce a good file, try
         "X -configure" as root.  This will produce a "best guess"
         xorg.conf.new file, which can be used as a starting point
         for your modifications.

       See the X.Org XOrgVersion documentation available at:

              /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/

       See also Xorg(1), xorg.conf(5).

    b. For the XFree86 3.3.6 server, run XF86Setup(1) or xf86config3(1).

       - This will make the /etc/XF86Config file.
       - This will create /usr/X11R6/bin/X as a link to your XF86_* server,
         one of the XFree86 3.3.6 servers listed in item 2 above.
       - If for some reason XF86Setup(1) doesn't work on your hardware, try
         the alternate program xf86config3(1).

       See the XF86Config user's guide for XFree86 3.3.6 servers at:

              /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/XFree86-3.3.6/QuickStart.doc

       For manual configuration information, see xf86config-3(5).

4. Start either xdm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xdm(1), the X display manager by activating the xdm_flags option
      in /etc/rc.conf(8) or /etc/rc.conf.local(8).

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.
 
5. With X.Org XOrgVersion, you can use antialiased fonts in some applications.
