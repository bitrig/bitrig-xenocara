// dumpkeymap.c
//
//	Prints a textual representation of each Apple/NeXT .keymapping file
//	mentioned on the command-line.  If no files are mentioned and if the
//	local machine is an Apple or NeXT installation, then the key mapping
//	currently in use by the WindowServer and the AppKit is printed
//	instead.
//
//	Invoke dumpkeymap with one of the options listed below in order to
//	view detailed documentation about .keymapping files and the use of
//	this program.
//
//	--help: Usage summary.
//	--help-keymapping: Detailed discussion of the internal format of a
//	    .keymapping file.
//	--help-output: Explanation of dumpkeymap's output.
//	--help-files: List of key mapping-related files and directories.
//	--help-diagnostics: Explanation of diagnostic messages.
//
// COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
//
//	MacOS/X, Darwin
//	cc -Wall -o dumpkeymap dumpkeymap.c -framework IOKit
//
//	MacOS/X DP4 (Developer Preview 4)
//	cc -Wall -o dumpkeymap dumpkeymap.c -FKernel -framework IOKit
//
//	MacOS/X Server, OpenStep, NextStep
//	cc -Wall -o dumpkeymap dumpkeymap.c
//
//	By default, dumpkeymap is configured to interface with the HID driver
//	(Apple) or event-status driver (NeXT), thus allowing it to dump the
//	key mapping which is currently in use by the WindowServer and AppKit.
//	However, these facilities are specific to Apple/NeXT.  In order to
//	build dumpkeymap for non-Apple/NeXT platforms, you must define the
//	DUMPKEYMAP_FILE_ONLY flag when compiling the program.  This flag
//	inhibits use of the HID and event-status drivers and configures
//	dumpkeymap to work strictly with raw key mapping files.
//
//	For example, to compile for Linux:
//	gcc -Wall -DDUMPKEYMAP_FILE_ONLY -o dumpkeymap dumpkeymap.c
//
// CONCLUSION
//
//	This program and its accompanying documentation were written by Eric
//	Sunshine and are copyright (C)1999,2000 by Eric Sunshine
//	<sunshine@sunshineco.com>.
//
//	The implementation of dumpkeymap is based upon information gathered
//	on September 3, 1997 by Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com> and
//	Paul S. McCarthy <zarnuk@zarnuk.com> during an effort to reverse
//	engineer the format of the NeXT .keymapping file.
//
// HISTORY
//
//	v4 2000/12/01 Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com>
//	    Updated manual page to work with `rman', the `man' to `HTML'
//		translator.  Unfortunately, however, rman is missing important
//		roff features such as diversions, indentation, and tab stops,
//		and is also hideously buggy, so getting the manual to work with
//		rman required quite a few work-arounds.
//	    The manual page has now been tested with nroff (plain text), troff
//		(PostScript, etc.), groff (PostScript), and rman (HTML, etc.)
//
//	v3 2000/11/28 Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com>
//	    Considerably expanded the documentation.
//	    Augmented the existing description of .keymapping internals.
//	    Added these new documentation topics:
//		- Output: Very important section describing how to interpret
//		  the output of dumpkeymap.
//		- Files: Lists files and directories related to key mappings.
//		- Diagnostics: Explains diagnostic messages issued by
//		  dumpkeymap.
//	    Created a manual page (dumpkeymap.1) which contains the complete
//		set of documentation for key mapping files and dumpkeymap.
//	    Added command-line options (--help, --help-keymapping,
//		--help-output, --help-files, --help-diagnostics) which allow
//		access to all key mapping documentation.  Previously the
//		description of the internal layout of a .keymapping file was
//		only available as source code comments.
//	    Added --version option.
//	    Ported to non-Apple/NeXT platforms.  Defining the pre-processor
//		flag DUMPKEYMAP_FILE_ONLY at compilation time inhibits use of
//		Apple/NeXT-specific API.
//	    Added a README file.
//
//	v2 2000/11/13 Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com>
//	    Converted from C++ to plain-C.
//	    Now parses and takes into account the "number-size" flag stored
//		with each key map.  This flag indicates the size, in bytes, of
//		all remaining numeric values in the mapping.  Updated all code
//		to respect this flag.  (Previously, the purpose of this field
//		was unknown, and it was thus denoted as
//		`KeyMapping::fill[2]'.)
//	    Updated all documentation; especially the "KEY MAPPING
//		DESCRIPTION" section.  Added discussion of the "number-size"
//		flag and revamped all structure definitions to use the generic
//		data type `number' instead of `uchar' or 'byte'.  Clarified
//		several sections of the documentation and added missing
//		discussions about type definitions and the relationship of
//		`interface' and `handler_id' to .keymapping and .keyboard
//		files.
//	    Updated compilation instructions to include directions for all
//		platforms on which this program might be built.
//	    Now published under the formal BSD license rather than a
//		home-grown license.
//
//	v1 1999/09/08 Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com>
//	    Created.

"Types and Data\n"

"The following type definitions are employed throughout this discussion:\n"
"\n"
"    typedef unsigned char  byte;\n"
"    typedef unsigned short word;\n"
"    typedef unsigned long  dword;\n"
"\n"
"Additionally, the type definition `number' is used generically to indicate\n"
"a numeric value.  The actual size of the `number' type may be one or two\n"
"bytes depending upon how the data is stored in the key map.  Although most\n"
"key maps use byte-sized numeric values, word-sized values are also allowed.\n"
"\n"
"Multi-byte values in a key mapping file are stored in big-endian byte\n"
"order.\n"
"\n"
"Key Mapping File and Device Mapping\n"
"-----------------------------------\n"
"A key mapping file begins with a magic-number and continues with a variable\n"
"number of device-specific key mappings.\n"
"\n"
"    struct KeyMappingFile {\n"
"        char magic_number[4];    // `KYM1'\n"
"        DeviceMapping maps[...]; // Variable number of maps\n"
"    };\n"
"\n"
"    struct DeviceMapping {\n"
"        dword interface;  // Interface type\n"

"        dword map_size;   // Byte count of `map' (below)\n"
"        KeyMapping map;\n"
"    };\n"
"\n"
"The value of `interface' represents a family of keyboard device types\n"
"(such as Intel PC, ADB, NeXT, Sun Type5, etc.), and is generally\n"
"specified as one of the constant values NX_EVS_DEVICE_INTERFACE_ADB,\n"
"NX_EVS_DEVICE_INTERFACE_ACE, etc., which are are defined in IOHIDTypes.h on\n"
"MacOS/X and Darwin, and in ev_types.h on MacOS/X Server, OpenStep, and\n"

"\n"
"The value of `handler_id' represents a specific keyboard layout within the\n"
"much broader `interface' family.  For instance, for a 101-key Intel PC\n"
"keyboard (of type NX_EVS_DEVICE_INTERFACE_ACE) the `handler_id' is '0',\n"
"whereas for a 102-key keyboard it is `1'.\n"

"representation of a keyboard layout, match `interface' and `handler_id'\n"
"from the .keymapping file against the `interface' and `handler_id' values\n"
"found in each .keyboard file.\n"
"\n"
"Key Mapping\n"
"-----------\n"
"A key mapping completely defines the relationship of all scan codes with\n"
"their associated functionality.  A KeyMapping structure is embedded within\n"
"the DeviceMapping structure in a KeyMappingFile.  The key mapping currently\n"
"in use by the WindowServer and AppKit is also represented by a KeyMapping\n"
"structure, and can be referred to directly by calling NXGetKeyMapping() and\n"
"accessing the `mapping' data member of the returned NXKeyMapping structure.\n"
"\n"
"    struct KeyMapping {\n"
"        word number_size;                   // 0=1 byte, non-zero=2 bytes\n"

"        Sequence sequence_lists[...];\n"
"        number num_special_keys;            // Special keys\n"
"        SpecialKey special_key[...];\n"
"    };\n"
"\n"
"The `number_size' flag determines the size, in bytes, of all remaining\n"
"numeric values (denoted by the type definition `number') within the key\n"
"mapping.  If its value is zero, then numbers are represented by a single\n"
"byte.  If it is non-zero, then numbers are represented by a word (two\n"
"bytes).\n"
"\n"
"Modifier Group\n"
"--------------\n"
"A modifier group defines all scan codes which map to a particular type of\n"
"modifier, such as `shift', `control', etc.\n"
"\n"
"    enum Modifier {\n"
"        ALPHALOCK = 0,\n"
"        SHIFT,\n"
"        CONTROL,\n"
"        ALTERNATE,\n"

"        number num_scan_codes;\n"
"        number scan_codes[...]; // Variable number of scan codes\n"
"    };\n"
"\n"
"The scan_codes[] array contains a list of all scan codes which map to the\n"
"specified modifier.  The `shift', `command', and `alternate' modifiers are\n"
"frequently mapped to two different scan codes, apiece, since these\n"
"modifiers often appear on both the left and right sides of the keyboard.\n"
"\n"
"Scan Group\n"
"----------\n"
"There is one ScanGroup for each scan code generated by the given keyboard.\n"
"This number is given by KeyMapping::num_scan_codes.  The first scan group\n"
"represents hardware scan code 0, the second represents scan code 1, etc.\n"
"\n"
"    enum ModifierMask {\n"
"        ALPHALOCK_MASK       = 1 << 0,\n"

"\n"
"    struct ScanGroup {\n"
"        number mask;\n"
"        Character characters[...];\n"
"    };\n"
"\n"
"For each scan code, `mask' defines which modifier combinations generate\n"
"characters.  If `mask' is NOT_BOUND (0xff) then then this scan code does\n"
"not generate any characters ever, and its characters[] array is zero\n"
"length.  Otherwise, the characters[] array contains one Character record\n"
"for each modifier combination.\n"
"\n"
"The number of records in characters[] is determined by computing (1 <<\n"
"bits_set_in_mask).  In other words, if mask is zero, then zero bits are\n"
"set, so characters[] contains only one record.  If `mask' is (SHIFT_MASK |\n"
"CONTROL_MASK), then two bits are set, so characters[] contains four\n"
"records.\n"
"\n"
"The first record always represents the character which is generated by that\n"
"key when no modifiers are active.  The remaining records represent\n"
"characters generated by the various modifier combinations.  Using the\n"
"example with the `shift' and `control' masks set, record two would\n"
"represent the character with the `shift' modifier active; record three, the\n"
"`control' modifier active; and record four, both the `shift' and `control'\n"
"modifiers active.\n"
"\n"
"As a special case, ALPHALOCK_MASK implies SHIFT_MASK, though only\n"
"ALPHALOCK_MASK appears in `mask'.  In this case the same character is\n"
"generated for both the `shift' and `alpha-lock' modifiers, but only needs\n"
"to appear once in the characters[] array.\n"
"\n"
"CARRIAGE_RETURN_MASK does not actually refer to a modifier key.  Instead,\n"
"it is used to distinguish the scan code which is given the special\n"
"pseudo-designation of `carriage return' key.  Typically, this mask appears\n"
"solo in a ScanGroup record and only the two Character records for control-M\n"
"and control-C follow.  This flag may be a throwback to an earlier time or\n"
"may be specially interpreted by the low-level keyboard driver, but its\n"
"purpose is otherwise enigmatic.\n"
"Character\n"
"---------\n"
"Each Character record indicates the character generated when this key is\n"
"pressed, as well as the character set which contains the character.  Well\n"
"known character sets are `ASCII' and `Symbol'.  The character set can also\n"
"be one of the meta values FUNCTION_KEY or KEY_SEQUENCE.  If it is\n"
"FUNCTION_KEY then `char_code' represents a generally well-known function\n"
"key such as those enumerated by FunctionKey.  If the character set is\n"

"    };\n"
"\n"
"Sequence\n"
"--------\n"
"When Character::set contains the meta value KEY_SEQUENCE, the scan code is\n"
"bound to a sequence of keys rather than a single character.  A sequence is\n"
"a series of modifiers and characters which are automatically generated when\n"
"the associated key is depressed.\n"
"\n"
"    #define MODIFIER_KEY 0xff\n"
"\n"
"    struct Sequence {\n"
"        number num_chars;\n"
"        Character characters[...];\n"
"    };\n"
"\n"
"Each generated Character is represented as previously described, with the\n"
"exception that MODIFIER_KEY may appear in place of KEY_SEQUENCE.  When the\n"
"value of Character::set is MODIFIER_KEY then Character::char_code\n"
"represents a modifier key rather than an actual character.  If the modifier\n"
"represented by `char_code' is non-zero, then it indicates that the\n"
"associated modifier key has been depressed.  In this case, the value is one\n"
"of the constants enumerated by Modifier (SHIFT, CONTROL, ALTERNATE, etc.).\n"
"If the value is zero then it means that the modifier keys have been\n"
"released.\n"
"\n"
"Special Key\n"
"-----------\n"
"A special key is one which is scanned directly by the Mach kernel rather\n"
"than by the WindowServer.  In general, events are not generated for special\n"
"keys.\n"

"\n"
"Conventions\n"
"-----------\n"
"Depending upon context, some numeric values are displayed in decimal\n"
"notation, whereas others are displayed in hexadecimal notation.\n"
"Hexadecimal numbers are denoted by a `0x' prefix (for instance, `0x7b'),\n"
"except when explicitly noted otherwise.\n"
"\n"
"Key Mapping Source\n"
"------------------\n"
"The first piece of information presented about a particular key mapping is\n"
"the source from which the data was gleaned.  For a .keymapping file, the\n"
"title `KEYMAP FILE' is emitted along with the path and name of the file in\n"
"question.  For the key mapping currently in use by the WindowServer and\n"
"AppKit, the title `ACTIVE KEYMAP' is emitted instead.\n"
"\n"
"Device Information\n"
"------------------\n"
"Each .keymapping file may contain one or more raw key mappings.  For\n"
"example, a file which maps keys to a Dvorak-style layout might contain raw\n"
"mappings for Intel PC, ADB, NeXT, and Sun Type5 keyboards.\n"
"\n"
"For each raw mapping, the following information is emitted:\n"
"\n"
"    o The title `KEYMAP' along with the mapping's relative position in the\n"
"      .keymapping file.\n"
"    o The `interface' identifier.\n"
"    o The `handler_id' sub-identifier.\n"
"    o The size of the raw mapping resource counted in bytes.\n"
"\n"
"The `interface' and `handler_id' values, taken together, define a specific\n"
"keyboard device.  A .keyboard file, which describes the visual layout of a\n"
"keyboard, also contains `interface' and `handler_id' identifiers.  The\n"
".keyboard file corresponding to a particular key mapping can be found by\n"
"matching the `interface' and `handler_id' values from each resource.\n"
"\n"
"Modifiers\n"
"---------\n"
"Each mapping may contain zero or more modifier records which associate\n"
"hardware scan codes with modifier descriptions such as `shift', `control',\n"
"`alternate', etc.  The title `MODIFIERS' is printed along with the count of\n"
"modifier records which follow.  For each modifier record, the modifier's\n"
"name is printed along with a list of scan codes, in hexadecimal format,\n"
"which generate that modifier value.  For example:\n"
"\n"
"    MODIFIERS [4]\n"
"    alternate: 0x1d 0x60\n"
"    control: 0x3a\n"
"    keypad: 0x52 0x53 ... 0x63 0x62\n"
"    shift: 0x2a 0x36\n"
"\n"
"Characters\n"
"----------\n"
"Each mapping may contain zero or more character records which associate\n"
"hardware scan codes with the actual characters generated by those scan\n"
"codes in the presence or absence of various modifier combinations.  The\n"
"title `CHARACTERS' is printed along with the count of character records\n"
"which follow.  Here is a highly abbreviated example:\n"
"\n"
"    CHARACTERS [9]\n"
"    scan 0x00: -AC-L  \"a\" \"A\" \"^A\" \"^A\" ca c7 \"^A\" \"^A\"\n"
"    scan 0x07: -AC-L  \"x\" \"X\" \"^X\" \"^X\" 01/b4 01/ce \"^X\" \"^X\"\n"
"    scan 0x0a: ---S-  \"<\" \">\"\n"
"    scan 0x13: -ACS-  \"2\" \"@\" \"^@\" \"^@\" b2 b3 \"^@\" \"^@\"\n"
"    scan 0x24: R----  \"^M\" \"^C\"\n"
"    scan 0x3e: -----  [F4]\n"
"    scan 0x4a: -----  [page up]\n"
"    scan 0x60: -----  {seq#3}\n"
"    scan 0x68: not-bound\n"
"\n"
"For each record, the hexadecimal value of the hardware scan code is\n"
"printed, followed by a list of modifier flag combinations and the actual\n"
"characters generated by this scan code with and without modifiers applied.\n"
"\n"
"The modifier flags field is composed of a combination of single letter\n"
"representations of the various modifier types.  The letters stand for:\n"
"\n"
"    L - alpha-lock\n"
"    S - shift\n"
"    C - control\n"
"    A - alternate\n"
"    R - carriage-return\n"
"\n"
"As a special case, the `alpha-lock' flag also implies the `shift' flag, so\n"
"these two flags never appear together in the same record.\n"
"\n"
"The combination of modifier flags determines the meaning and number of\n"
"fields which follow.  The first field after the modifier flags always\n"
"represents the character that will be generated if no modifier keys are\n"
"depressed.  The remaining fields represent characters generated by the\n"
"various modifier combinations.  The order of the fields follows this\n"
"general pattern:\n"
"\n"
"    o The character generated by this scan code when no modifiers are in\n"
"      effect is listed first.\n"
"\n"
"    o If the `L' or `S' flag is active, then the shifted character\n"
"      generated by this scan code is listed next.\n"
"\n"
"    o If the `C' flag is active, then the control-character generated by\n"
"      this scan code is listed next.  Furthermore, if the `L' or `S' flag\n"
"      is also active, then the shifted control-character is listed after\n"
"      that.\n"
"\n"
"    o If the `A' flag is active, then the alternate-character generated by\n"
"      this scan code is listed next.  Furthermore, if the `L' or `S' flag\n"
"      is active, then the shifted alternate-character is listed after that.\n"
"      If the `C' flag is also active, then the alternate-control-character\n"
"      is listed next.  Finally, if the `C' and `L' or `C' and `S' flags are\n"
"      also active, then the shifted alternate-control-character is listed.\n"
"\n"
"The `R' flag does not actually refer to a modifier key.  Instead, it is\n"
"used to distinguish the scan code which is given the special\n"
"pseudo-designation of `carriage return' key.  Typically, this mask appears\n"
"solo and only the two fields for control-M and control-C follow.  This flag\n"
"may be a throwback to an earlier time or may be specially interpreted by\n"
"the low-level keyboard driver, but its purpose is otherwise enigmatic.\n"
"\n"
"Recalling the example from above, the following fields can be identified:\n"
"\n"
"    scan 0x00: -AC-L  \"a\" \"A\" \"^A\" \"^A\" ca c7 \"^A\" \"^A\"\n"
"\n"
"    o Lower-case `a' is generated when no modifiers are active.\n"
"    o Upper-case `A' is generated when `shift' or `alpha-lock' are active.\n"
"    o Control-A is generated when `control' is active.\n"
"    o Control-A is generated when `control' and `shift' are active.\n"
"    o The character represented by the hexadecimal code 0xca is generated\n"
"      when `alternate' is active.\n"
"    o The character represented by 0xc7 is generated when `alternate' and\n"
"      `shift' (or `alpha-lock') are active.\n"
"    o Control-A is generated when `alternate' and `control' are active.\n"
"    o Control-A is generated when `alternate', `control' and `shift' (or\n"
"      `alpha-lock') are active.\n"
"\n"
"The notation used to represent a particular generated character varies.\n"
"\n"
"    o Printable ASCII characters are quoted, as in \"x\" or \"X\".\n"
"\n"
"    o Control-characters are quoted and prefixed with `^', as in \"^X\".\n"
"\n"
"    o Characters with values greater than 127 (0x7f) are displayed as\n"
"      hexadecimal values without the `0x' prefix.\n"
"\n"
"    o Characters in a non-ASCII character set (such as `Symbol') are\n"
"      displayed as two hexadecimal numbers separated by a slash, as in\n"
"      `01/4a'.  The first number is the character set's identification code\n"
"      (such as `01' for the `Symbol' set), and the second number is the\n"
"      value of the generated character.\n"
"\n"
"    o Non-printing special function characters are displayed with the\n"
"      function's common name enclosed in brackets, as in `[page up]' or\n"
"      `[F4]'.\n"
"\n"
"    o If the binding represents a key sequence rather than a single\n"
"      character, then the sequence's identification number is enclosed in\n"
"      braces, as in `{seq#3}'.\n"
"\n"
"Recalling a few examples from above, the following interpretations can be\n"
"made:\n"
"\n"
"    scan 0x07: -AC-L  \"x\" \"X\" \"^X\" \"^X\" 01/b4 01/ce \"^X\" \"^X\"\n"
"    scan 0x3e: -----  [F4]\n"
"    scan 0x4a: -----  [page up]\n"
"    scan 0x60: -----  {seq#3}\n"
"\n"
"    o \"x\" and \"X\" are printable ASCII characters.\n"
"    o \"^X\" is a control-character.\n"
"    o `01/b4' and `01/ce' represent the character codes 0xb4 and 0xce in\n"
"      the `Symbol' character set.\n"
"    o Scan code 0x3e generates function-key `F4', and scan code 0x4a\n"
"      generates function-key `page up'.\n"
"    o Scan code 0x60 is bound to key sequence #3.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, if a scan code is not bound to any characters, then it is\n"
"annotated with the label `not-bound', as with example scan code 0x68 from\n"
"above.\n"
"\n"
"Sequences\n"
"---------\n"
"A scan code (modified and unmodified) can be bound to a key sequence rather\n"
"than generating a single character or acting as a modifier.  When it is\n"
"bound to a key sequence, a series of character invocations and modifier\n"
"actions are automatically generated rather than a single keystroke.\n"
"\n"
"Each mapping may contain zero or more key sequence records.  The title\n"
"`SEQUENCES' is printed along with the count of sequence records which\n"
"follow.  For example:\n"
"\n"
"    SEQUENCES [3]\n"
"    sequence 0: \"f\" \"o\" \"o\"\n"
"    sequence 1: {alternate} \"b\" \"a\" \"r\" {unmodify}\n"
"    sequence 2: [home] \"b\" \"a\" \"z\"\n"
"\n"
"The notation used to represent the sequence of generated characters is\n"
"identical to the notation already described in the `Characters' section\n"
"above, with the exception that modifier actions may be interposed between\n"
"generated characters.  Such modifier actions are represented by the\n"
"modifier's name enclosed in braces.  The special name `{unmodify}'\n"
"indicates the release of the modifier keys.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, the sequences in the above example can be interpreted as follows:\n"
"\n"
"    o Sequence #0 generates `foo'.\n"
"    o Sequence #1 invokes the `alternate' modifier, generates `bar', and\n"
"      then releases `alternate'.\n"
"    o Sequence #2 invokes the `home' key and then generates `baz'.  In a\n"
"      text editor, this would probably result in `baz' being prepended to\n"
"      the line of text on which the cursor resides.\n"
"\n"
"Special Keys\n"
"------------\n"
"Certain keyboards feature keys which perform some type of special purpose\n"
"function rather than generating a character or acting as a modifier.  For\n"
"instance, Apple keyboards often contain a `power' key, and NeXT keyboards\n"
"have historically featured screen brightness and volume control keys.\n"
"\n"
"Each mapping may contain zero or more special-key records which associate\n"
"hardware scan codes with such special purpose functions.  The title\n"
"`SPECIALS' is printed along with the count of records which follow.  For\n"
"each record, the special function's name is printed along with a list of\n"
"scan codes, in hexadecimal format, which are bound to that function.  For\n"
"example:\n"
"\n"
"    SPECIALS [6]\n"
"    alpha-lock: 0x39\n"
"    brightness-down: 0x79\n"
"    brightness-up: 0x74\n"
"    power: 0x7f\n"
"    sound-down: 0x77\n"
