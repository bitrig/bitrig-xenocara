This is the default unless the shapeWindow resource is set to false.

causes the clock to not reshape itself and ancestors to exactly
fit the outline of the clock.
.TP 8
.B \-transparent
causes the clock to consist only of the jewel, the hands, and the border.
.SH COLORS
If you would like your clock to be viewable in color, include the following
in the #ifdef COLOR section you read with xrdb:
.sp 1
*customization:                 -color
.sp 1
.br
This will cause oclock to pick up the colors in the app-defaults color
customization file:
__projectroot__/lib/X11/app-defaults/Clock-color.
Below are the default colors:
.sp 1
Clock*Background: grey
.br
Clock*BorderColor: light blue
.br
Clock*hour: yellow
.br
Clock*jewel: yellow
.br
Clock*minute: yellow
