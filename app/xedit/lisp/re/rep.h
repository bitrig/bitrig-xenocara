/*  This value can not be larger than 255, a depth value is the nesting of

 * does. Note also that you cannot have more than 9 parenthesis pairs in
 * an expression.
 *  Depth is always at least 1. So for MAX_DEPTH 8, it is only allowed
 * 7 complex repetitions. A complex repetition is a dot followed by an
 * repetition operator. It is called a complex repetition because dot
 * matches anything but the empty string, so the engine needs to test
 * all possible combinations until the end of the string is found.
 *  Repetitions like .* use one depth until the end of the string is found,
 * for example a.*b.*c.*d has depth 4, while a*b*c*d has depth 2.
