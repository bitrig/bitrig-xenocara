    I. OVERVIEW

The xauth program is used to edit and display the authorization
information used in connecting to the X server.
The underlying "Authorization Protocol for X" is described in the
README file of the libXau module of X11.

    II. BUILDING

Use "./autogen.sh" to configure the package and "make" to compile it.
A black box check for the correctness of the package can be initiated
