    I. OVERVIEW

The xauth program is used to edit and display the authorization
information used in connecting to the X server.
The underlying "Authorization Protocol for X" is described in the
README file of the libXau module of X11.

    II. BUILDING

Use "./autogen.sh" to configure the package and "make" to compile it.
A black box check for the correctness of the package can be initiated
by "make check" (make sure to install "cmdtest" from
http://liw.fi/cmdtest/). The installation is done by "make install".

   III. COMMUNICATION

   IV. RELEASING

This section describes how to release a new version of xauth to the
public. A detailed description of this process can be found at
http://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/ReleaseHOWTO with a
few clarification below.

For releasing under Fedora make sure, that INSTALL in
/usr/share/util-macros/ exists. If not, then please create that
file.

To release a new version of xauth, please follow this steps:

 * git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/app/xauth
 * cd xauth ; ./autogen.sh ; make ; make check
 * follow ReleaseHowto inside this directory.

Ignore these errors shown during release.sh:

   /bin/sh: ../.changelog.tmp: Permission denied
   git directory not found: installing possibly empty changelog.

   cp: cannot create regular file '../.INSTALL.tmp': Permission denied
   util-macros "pkgdatadir" from xorg-macros.pc not found: installing possibly empty INSTALL.

   V. GARBAGE

Please ignore this paragraph. It is only used to satisfying
release.sh, which wants to see the version number to the last version
in the diff, which is 1.0.9 in our case.  This paragraph can be
deleted on the next release of xauth.
