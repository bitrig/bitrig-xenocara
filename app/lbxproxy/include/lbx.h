/*
 * Notes on request short-circuiting
 *
 * X guarentees that any replies, events or errors generated by a
 * previous request will be sent before those of a later request.
 * this means that any requests that can be handled by the proxy
 * must have their reply sent after any previous events or errors.
 *
 * there are 3 possible stages implemented here:
 *
 * - fully correct protocol, where nothing can be out of order
 * - mostly correct protocol, where only errors can be out of order
 * - poor protocol, where events & errors can be out of order
 *
 * for most applications, poor is 'good enough', because they don't
 * depend on events coming in order, and instead let Xlib do
 * the work.
 *
 * depending on the type of protocol being used, the cache_safe
 * flag in the ClientRec will be set appropriately, and if TRUE,
 * the proxy is cleared to short-circuit a request.
 *
 * for full correct protocol, the flag is set if the previous request
 * was a round trip and the reply has come back.
 *
 * for a mostly correct protocol, the flag is set for the above
 * case, and for requests that can generate only errors (mostly
 * graphics)
 *
 * for a 'good enough' protocol, the flag is always on, and we let
 * the client sort things out.
 *
 * (note than in no case do we allow replies to come out of order.)
 *
 *
 * Note on Xlib's handling of sequences:
 *
 * Xlib usually waits for the reply to sync request before
 * issuing another -- its archetecture depends on it.  However,
 * this is not required.  Xlib itself misses this in at least one
 * case (XGetWindowAttributes, which uses both the GetWindowAttributes
 * and GetGeometry requests).
 *
 * The upshot is that the proxy has to be able to handle seeing
 * another request before it receives an expected reply.
 *
 * this means we can't assume a single pending reply, but many.
 * currently these get tacked onto a list.
 *
 *
 * Notes on how the proxy attempts to solve all of this:
 *
 * There are 4 request that it will attempt to short-circuit:
 * InternAtom, GetAtomName, LookupColor, AllocColor, and AllocNamedColor.
 * All the code to do this is in lbxfuncs.c, and all of it works in
 * essentially the same way -- whenever possible, it will try to respond 
 * to the client without sending the request all the way to the X server.
 * The goal is to remove a roudn-trip entirely -- even though not a lot of data
 * is involved, remving the roundtrip can make this useful.

 * Unfortunately, figuring out *when* its safe is very nasty.  First
 * there are all the possibile stages outlined above.  If the proxy
 * isn't waiting, thinking there might be pending data, it can always
 * short-circuit the request.  However, this is the rare case.  When
 * the proxy can't immediately respond, it attempts to short-circuit anyways,
 * delaying the reply until whatever it was waiting on arrives.  Often
 * it can't -- if the most paranoid type of checking is turned on, it'll
 * never work.  The complex part occurs with loose checking.  If it knows
 * a reply is coming back, it can delay the short-circuit until it gets
 * the reply.  This works fine for the core protocol, but breaks down 
 * again for extensions -- to be safe, any unknown extensions are assumed
 * to have replies -- but since they may never arrive, the delayed
 * short-circuit can never be flushed.  To avoid this, whether a reply
 * has been guessed at is tracked, and this info is used to decide
 * whether a short-circuit can be delayed -- if not, it always needs
 * to do the full round-trip.
 *
 * The complexity really makes me wonder if this stuff is worth the effort...
