! X11 does a miserable job of providing resolution-independent drawing
! facilities---it expects everything to be done in pixels.  So if you
! happen to run your X server at a resolution of 100 pixels per inch
! (or some other strange value) instead of the widely used default of
! 75, x11-ssh-askpass looks might tiny.  [Sigh].
! 
! To get around this, umm, limitation, we declare the resolution that
! the spacing and width/height pixels values are "valid" for, along
! with a fuzz factor.  If the current actual resolution is outside of
! the range of <DEFAULT - FUZZ>..<DEFAULT + FUZZ>, then we scale pixel
! measurements to fit the actual resolution.
! 
! (And if you think *this* is a horrid hack, then take a look at the
! actual code, which has to deal with conversion to [cheesy fanfare]
! that's right---millimeters!!!  The right hand managed to slip that
! one in while the left hand was adding a '-dpi' switch to the sample
! server implementation.  I think both left feet were adding the
! RESOLUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y fields [in dots per inch, naturally]
! to the X Logical Font Description.  The irony is underwhelming.)
