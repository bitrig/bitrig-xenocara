2001-02-14 04:10  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: New version 1.2.0.

2001-02-14 04:07  jmknoble

	* README, x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h,
	x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Updated copyright notices to include 2001.

2001-02-14 04:06  jmknoble

	* Imakefile, README: Moved default BINDIR to
	/usr/local/libexec/openssh to conform with recent releases of
	portable OpenSSH.

2001-02-14 03:59  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h, x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Now
	x11-ssh-askpass understands newline characters ('\n') in text
	labels (both the prompt string and the button labels).	Each line
	of text in the label is displayed on a separate line in the dialog.
	 Requested by Markus Friedl
	<markus.friedl@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> to support
	challenge/response authentication in OpenSSH.

2001-02-14 03:49  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c: Bugfix: "*grabServer" resource was setting
	flag to grab pointer. Fixed.  (Not surprising that no one noticed;
	i suspect it's not very widely used).

2001-02-14 03:46  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Merged changes from matthieu@openbsd.org:
	Use .Nm instead of @NAME@. It fixes a strange formatting error.

2000-11-08 23:19  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: New version 1.1.1.

2000-11-08 23:19  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c: Fixed problem where inputTimeout of '0' was
	considered invalid due to bad octal conversion.  Fixed small
	potential memory leak.

2000-11-07 06:20  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Bumped version to 1.1.0.

2000-11-07 06:20  jmknoble

	* TODO: Added notes about recently done stuff (that's what todo
	lists are for, isn't it?;).

2000-11-07 06:16  jmknoble

	* SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad, SshAskpass-default.ad,
	SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad: Added new '*inputTimeout'
	resource, with explanatory comment.

2000-11-07 06:15  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Documented new '*inputTimeout' resource.

2000-11-07 06:15  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c: Fixed a few warnings, commented another. 
	Print message to stderr when we time out, so as not to completely
	confuse the user.

2000-11-07 05:42  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: Did stuff to handle timing
	out if no input received.  In particular, this required changing
	XNextEvent() in main application loop to XtAppNextEvent().  May
	make this larger and more cumbersome....
	
	Also did stuff to make the button labels shift down and to the
	right when pressed if they're drawn with 3D shading/highlighting,
	so that they actually *look* pressed.
	
	Finally, added code to handle MotionNotify events, so that buttons
	don't continue to look pressed if the pointer button is pressed,
	but the pointer is outside the button.	Wheeeee!  Now we have an
	actual user interface!

2000-11-07 05:23  jmknoble

	* SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad, SshAskpass-default.ad,
	SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad: Converted colors from
	old-style "#rrggbb" to new-style "rgb:rr/gg/bb".  Corrected typo in
	perspicacious commentary.

2000-10-30 05:28  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Bumped version to 1.0.3.

2000-10-30 05:28  jmknoble

	* SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad, SshAskpass-default.ad,
	SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad: Added resources used for
	pseudo-resolution-independence, along with default values and long,
	drawn out, but mildly fulfilling explanation.

2000-10-30 05:27  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Documented the new resources for
	pseudo-resolution-independence (defaultXResolution,
	defaultYResolution, xResolutionFuzz, and yResolutionFuzz).

2000-10-30 05:25  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: Added a small amount of
	resolution-independence to the dialog widgets.	Now we detect the
	actual X and Y resolution the server is running at; and if they're
	significantly different from the ones our resource settings expect,
	then we stretch or shrink buttons, indicators, and spacing to fit
	the actual resolution.	Sometimes X11 really makes my stomach
	hurt....

2000-09-24 00:51  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: New version 1.0.2.

2000-09-24 00:43  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: Added process ID to
	diagnostic/error messages on stderr (helps when more than one
	ssh-askpass is started, e.g., with a shortcut key and keyboard
	repeat).
	
	Modified keyboard and pointer grabbing so that, if we don't get the
	keyboard or pointer the first time, we print a helpful message,
	sleep, and then retry.	If we time out without successfully getting
	the keyboard or pointer, then we fail as before.
	
	Combined the logic for grabKeyboard() and grabPointer() into a
	common function performGrab().	This makes it easier to ensure that
	the grab/sleep logic is correct in both places.
	
	Fixed, worked around or commented on a few warnings emitted by 'gcc
	-Wall -W -ansi -pedantic'.

2000-09-24 00:32  jmknoble

	* resources.c: Removed unused declaration of get_time_resource.

2000-08-28 03:35  jmknoble

	* Imakefile, TODO: Added TODO file for listing potential future
	projects within x11-ssh-askpass.

2000-08-28 03:35  jmknoble

	* README: Added 'make install.man' to installation instructions. 
	Formulated better wording for reference to (now ancient) Perl/Tk
	ssh-askpass.

2000-08-28 03:26  jmknoble

	* Imakefile, x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Added facilities to Imakefile
	and man page to automatically insert name, date, and version into
	man page.  Changed install target to include man page.	Rearranged
	clean and dist targets slightly.  Ready for release.

2000-08-28 02:54  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Added corrections and clarifications: 
	Mentioned optional label on command line; noted which toolkit
	options are unsupported; and added extra indicator-specific
	resources.

2000-08-28 02:00  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c: Moved saving of argc/argv to after call to
	XtAppInitialize(), so that toolkit arguments get properly removed
	from the argument list.

2000-08-28 01:43  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Changed author email address from
	pobox.com to jmknoble.cx.  Added 2000 to copyright date.

2000-08-28 01:42  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Added man page for x11-ssh-askpass from
	Matthieu Herrb <matthieu@laas.fr> of OpenBSD.

2000-08-28 01:31  jmknoble

	* README, SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad,
	SshAskpass-default.ad, SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad,
	dynlist.c, dynlist.h, x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: Changed
	ISO-8859-1 copyright character '©' to ASCII '(C)'.

2000-08-28 01:27  jmknoble

	* README, SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad,
	SshAskpass-default.ad, SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad,
	drawing.c, drawing.h, dynlist.c, dynlist.h, resources.c,
	resources.h, x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: Changed author
	email address from pobox.com to jmknoble.cx.  Added 2000 to
	copyright date.

2000-08-28 01:19  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c: Oops.  When the keyboard or pointer grab
	failed, the fprintf() calls to print the error message were missing
	the 'reason' argument.	Thanks to Daniel Packman
	<pack@mop2.eos.ucar.edu>.

2000-08-28 01:17  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Portability enhancements to Imakefile, suggested by
	Charles Levert <charles@comm.polymtl.ca>.   Use imake's '...Cmd'
	macros where available; otherwise, use less-nonportable commands.
	
	Bumped version to 1.0.1.

2000-01-07 04:53  jmknoble

	* README: Added note about location of x11-ssh-askpass.

2000-01-07 04:52  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Now we install the actual program as
	`x11-ssh-askpass', and make a symlink to that from `ssh-askpass'. 
	This allows for multiple passphrase dialogs on a system.
	
	Bumped version to 1.0.

1999-12-24 01:59  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Oops.  Version backed out to 0.99; missing spec file
	for building RPMs.

1999-12-24 01:05  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Updated version to 1.0.  Removed reference to utils.h.
	 Prefer install targets available in X11R6.

1999-12-24 01:00  jmknoble

	* README: Updated install directory.  Removed reference to utils.h.

1999-12-24 00:58  jmknoble

	* resources.c, resources.h: Moved header includes from utils.h into
	resources.c.  Trimmed unused functions.

1999-12-24 00:56  jmknoble

	* dynlist.c: Removed potential memory leak (and ensuing loss of
	buffer contents) if realloc() failed.

1999-12-24 00:53  jmknoble

	* utils.h: Moved header includes from here into resources.c.

1999-12-04 23:21  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Added patch from Markus Friedl to change use of awk
	(with GNU-specific extensions?) to sed, more likely to be available
	on various platforms.

1999-11-23 05:16  jmknoble

	* .cvsignore: Added ChangeLog to .cvsignore.

1999-11-23 05:14  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Added facility for autogenerating ChangeLog using
	cvs2cl.

1999-11-23 04:57  jmknoble

	* .cvsignore, README, README.x11-ssh-askpass:
	README.x11-ssh-askpass moved to README.  Shorter.

1999-11-23 04:55  jmknoble

	* .cvsignore: Added .cvsignore file.

1999-11-23 04:53  jmknoble

	* Imakefile, SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad,
	SshAskpass-default.ad, SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad,
	x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: - Added version to tarball. 
	- *grab(Keyboard|Pointer|Server) resources had inverted values in  
	app-defaults files.  - Futzed with spacing in default and NeXTish
	themes.  - Added setrlimit() call to main() to avoid core dumps.

1999-11-23 04:50  jmknoble

	* Imakefile, SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad,
	SshAskpass-default.ad, SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad,
	resources.c, resources.h, x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: -
	Can optionally grab server (*grabServer resource, off by default). 
	- get_pixel_resource(), get_integer_resource() now take default
	value.	- Added minimum/maximum indicator count.  - memset()
	passphrase to 0s before freeing.  - Use fputs() instead of printf()
	to avoid possibility of passphrase   getting stored in dynamic
	memory by stdio.
