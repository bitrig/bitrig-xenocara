				xinput
				======

Overview
========

xinput is a utility to configure and test XInput devices. It wasn't
originally designed to be the primary tool for doing this but it's
still pretty much the only program out there for doing it. :-)

Requirements
============

xinput depends on the X11 headers and particularly the XInput headers.
As xinput now supports the new device types added in Xserver 1.4 (Xorg 7.3),
your headers must be from that version or newer.

Otherwise it will just require a working ANSI C compiler.

Building and Installation
=========================

xinput uses autotools so the usual pattern applies:

./configure
make
make install

See the INSTALL file for details.
