<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>xlock</B> locks the X server till the user enters  their  password  at  the
       keyboard.   While  <B>xlock</B>  is  running,  all  new server connections are
       refused.  The screen saver is disabled.  The  mouse  cursor  is  turned
       off.   The  screen  is  blanked  and  a  changing pattern is put on the
       screen.  If a key or a  mouse  button  is  pressed  then  the  user  is
       prompted for the password of the user who started <B>xlock</B>.

       If the correct password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the X
       server is restored.  When typing the password Control-U  and  Control-H
       are  active  as  kill  and erase respectively.  To return to the locked
       screen, click in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

       In the lower part of the password screen a  text  is  displayed.   This
       message  is  taken  from  the  first file of the following that exists:
       $HOME/.xlocktext, $HOME/.plan, or $HOME/.signature.

       On systems which support new BSD style authentication, the password may
       be  prefixed  by  an  authentication  style  followed  by a colon (i.e.
       "style:password").  See  the  <B>login.conf(5)</B>  for  more  information  on
       authentication styles.

            The  <I>display</I> option sets the X11 display to lock.  <B>xlock</B> locks all
            available screens on a given server, and restricts you to  locking
            only  a local server such as <B>unix:0,</B> <B>localhost:0,</B> or <B>:0</B> unless you

       <B>-size</B> <I>num</I>
            The  <I>size</I> option sets the size maximum size of a star in bouboule,
            pyro and star, size of ball in ball and bounce,  size  of  bat  in
            bat,  maximum  size  of  bubble in bubble, size of clock in clock,

            In  flow  and swarm it is the length of the lines.  In atlantis it
            is the shark size.  A negative number allows for randomness, simi-
            lar  to <I>count.</I>  In atunnels, fire, gears, sballs and sproingies it
            is the size of the screen (default 400), this is because  on  many
            slow  systems  it  runs  too slow when the picture covers the full
            screen.  Set to 0 for full screen on fast machines.

       <B>-ncolors</B> <I>num</I>
            The <I>ncolors</I> option sets the maximum number of colors to be used.

       <B>-saturation</B> <I>value</I>
            The <I>saturation</I> option sets saturation of the color  ramp  used  to
            <I>value</I>  <I>.</I>   0 is grayscale and 1 is very rich color.  0.4 is a nice
            pastel.

       <B>-erasemode</B> <I>modename</I>
            As of this writing there are over 12 erase modes supported (if its
            not chosen its assumed random).  The erase modes are random_lines,
            random_squares,  venetian,  triple_wipe,  quad_wipe,  circle_wipe,

       <B>-/+inwindow</B>
            Runs <B>xlock</B> in a window, so that you can iconify, move,  or  resize
            it  and  still use your screen for other stuff.  When running in a
            window, <B>xlock</B> no longer locks your screen, it just looks good.

       <B>-/+inroot</B>
            Runs <B>xlock</B> in your root window.  Like the <I>inwindow</I>  option  it  no
            longer locks the screen, it just looks good.

       <B>-/+remote</B>
            The  <I>remote</I> option tells <B>xlock</B> to not stop you from locking remote
            X11 servers.  This option should be used with care and is intended
            mainly  to  lock X11 terminals which cannot run <B>xlock</B> locally.  If
            you lock someone else's workstation, they will have to  know  <B>your</B>
            password  to  unlock  it.   Using  <I>+remote</I>  overrides any resource
            derived values for <I>remote</I> and prevents <B>xlock</B> from  being  used  to
            lock  other  X11  servers.   (Use  `+'  instead of `-' to override
            resources for other options that can take the `+'  modifier  simi-
            larly.)

       <B>-/+mono</B>
            The  <I>mono</I>  option  causes  <B>xlock</B> to display monochrome, (black and
            white) pixels rather than the default colored ones on  color  dis-
            plays.

       <B>-/+allowaccess</B>
            This  option is required for servers which do not allow clients to
            modify the host access control list.  It is  also  useful  if  you
            need  to  run  x clients on a server which is locked for some rea-
            son...  When <I>allowaccess</I> is true, the X11 server is left open  for
            clients  to  attach  and thus lowers the inherent security of this
            lock screen.  A side effect of using this option is that if  <B>xlock</B>
            is killed -KILL, the access control list is not lost.

       <B>-vtlock</B> <I>modename</I>
            This  option is used on a XFree86 system to manage VT switching in
            [off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.

       <I>off</I>       means no VT switch locking.

       <I>switch</I>    means VT switch locking + switching to xlock  VT  when  acti-
                 vated.

       <I>restore</I>   means  VT  switch  locking + switching to xlock VT when acti-
                 vated + switching back to previous VT when desactivated.

       <I>noswitch</I>  means VT switch locking only when xlock VT is active.

       <B>-/+allowroot</B>
            The <I>allowroot</I> option allows the root password to unlock the server
            as  well  as  the user who started <B>xlock</B>.  May not be able to turn

       <B>-echokey</B> <I>echokey</I>
            The text character to use for echo key in <I>echokeys</I> <I>.</I>

       <B>-/+enablesaver</B>
            By default <B>xlock</B> will disable the normal X server's  screen  saver
            since  it is in effect a replacement for it.  Since it is possible
            to set delay parameters long enough to cause phosphor burn on some
            displays,  this  option will turn back on the default screen saver
            which is very careful to keep most of the screen black.

       <B>-/+resetsaver</B>
            By default <B>xlock</B> will call XResetScreenSaver.  This may  be  unde-
            sirable with DPMS monitors.

       <B>-/+grabmouse</B>
            The  <I>grabmouse</I> option causes <B>xlock</B> to grab the mouse and keyboard,
            this is the default.  <B>xlock</B> can not lock the screen without  this.

       <B>-/+grabserver</B>
            The  <I>grabserver</I>  option  causes <B>xlock</B> to grab the server.  This is
            not usually needed but some unsecure X  servers  can  be  defeated
            without this.

       <B>-/+install</B>
            Allows <B>xlock</B> to install its own colormap if <B>xlock</B> runs out of col-
            ors.  May not work on with some window managers  (fvwm)  and  does
            not work with the -inroot option.

       <B>-/+mousemotion</B>
            Allows  you  to  turn  on  and off the sensitivity to the mouse to
            bring up the password window.

       <B>-/+sound</B>
            Allows you to turn on and off sound if installed with the capabil-
            ity.

       <B>-/+timeelapsed</B>
            Allows  you  to  find  out how long a machine is locked so you can
            complain to an administrator that someone is hogging a machine.

       <B>-/+usefirst</B>
            The <I>usefirst</I> option causes <B>xlock</B> to use the  keystroke  which  got
            you to the password screen as the first character in the password.
            The default is to ignore the first key pressed.

       <B>-/+verbose</B>
            Verbose mode, tells what options it is going to use.

       <B>-nice</B> <I>nicelevel</I>
            The <I>nice</I> option sets system nicelevel  of  the  <B>xlock</B>  process  to
            <I>nicelevel</I> <I>.</I>
            option sets the font to be used for the text that is displayed  in
            the lower part of the password screen.

       <B>-fg</B> <I>color</I>
            The <I>fg</I> option sets the color of the text on the password screen to
            <I>color</I> <I>.</I>

       <B>-bg</B> <I>color</I>
            The <I>bg</I> option sets the color of the  background  on  the  password
            screen to <I>color</I> <I>.</I>

       <B>-foreground</B> <I>color</I>
            The  <I>foreground</I>  option sets the color of the text on the password
            screen to <I>color</I> <I>.</I>

       <B>-background</B> <I>color</I>
            The <I>background</I> option sets the color  of  the  background  on  the
            password screen to <I>color</I> <I>.</I>

       <B>-username</B> <I>string</I>
            Text  <I>string</I> is shown in front of user name, defaults to "Name: ".

       <B>-password</B> <I>string</I>
            Text <I>string</I> is the password prompt string, defaults to  "Password:
            ".

       <B>-info</B> <I>string</I>
            Text  <I>string</I>  is an informational message to tell the user what to
            do, defaults to "Enter password to unlock; select icon to  lock.".

       <B>-validate</B> <I>string</I>
            Text  <I>string</I>  is  a  message  shown while validating the password,
            defaults to "Validating login..."

            Text <I>string</I> is a message shown when password is invalid,  defaults
            to "Invalid login."

       <B>-geometry</B> <I>geom</I>
            The <I>geometry</I> option sets <I>geom</I> the size and offset of the lock win-
            dow (normally the entire screen).  The  entire  screen  format  is
            still  used  for entering the password.  The purpose is to see the
            screen even though it is locked.  This should be used with caution
            since  many  of  the  modes  will fail if the windows are far from
            square or are too small (size must be  greater  than  0x0).   This
            should also be used with -enablesaver to protect screen from phos-
            phor burn.

       <B>-icongeometry</B> <I>geom</I>
            The <I>icongeometry</I> option sets <I>geom</I> the size of  the  iconic  screen
            (normally  64x64) seen when entering the password.  This should be
            used with caution since many of the modes will fail if the windows

            support was compiled in.

       <B>-modulepath</B> <I>path</I>
            The <I>modulepath</I> option sets the <I>directories</I> that <B>xlock</B> searches for
            mode modules to load.  It is a colon separated list of directories
            to  search. If "%S" is included in the path, it is replaced by the
            default modulepath.  To add a  private  module  directory  to  the
            default  path,  use something like '%S:~/mymoduledir' as the path.

            infinite).   (Horizontal sync off, Vertical sync off, Small auxil-
            iary circuit stays on to monitor the HS/VS signals to enable power
            on when data needs to be displayed on the screen.  Typical 17 inch
            screen ...  5 out of 120 watts with a 10 sec recovery time.)  This
            option is only available if DPMS support was compiled in.

       <B>-rule</B> <I>&lt;rule&gt;</I>
            The  rule string is defined as S&lt;neighborhood&gt;/B&lt;neighborhood&gt; for
            <I>life</I> and <I>life3d.</I>  Special parameters: P, picks a random rule  from
            all  rules  that  have known patterns; G, picks a random rule from
            all rules that have known gliders.  For <I>life</I>  a  good  example  is
            Conway's   rule   which   is   S23/B3.   Others  are  B36/S23  and
            B3678/S34678.  For <I>life3d</I> good examples are Bay's rules which  are
            S45/B5,  S567/B6, S56/B5, and S67/B67.  The rule string is defined
            as a binary string (requires at least one 1 and one 0) for <I>ant</I> and
            a base 4 (or quadranary) string (requires 3 of 4 digits to be rep-
            resented) for <I>ant3d.</I>  Here a special parameter, T and then a  num-

            "all" will get all files but blank  (and  bomb  if  compiled  in).
            "all,blank"  will  get all modes.  "all,-image bounce,+blank" will
            get all modes excluding image and bounce modes.  "bug wator"  will
            get  only  bug  and  wator.  "allgl" will get only the GL modes if
            compiled in, all-allgl will get all excluding the GL modes,  "all-
            nice"  will  weed out high cpu usage modes (as well as hackers and
            gl modes).  "allxpm" will get all modes that use xpm.   "allwrite"
            will  get all modes that take advantage of writable colormaps (not
            including xpm).  "all3d" will get all the modes that support  this
            option.   "allmouse"  will  get  all  the modes that support mouse
            interaction.  Similarly, "allautomata" for automata  modes,  "all-
            fractal"  for  fractal  modes,  "allgeometry"  for geometry modes,
            "allspace" for space modes.  The random mode  itself  can  not  be
            referenced.

<H2>**WARNING**</H2><PRE>
       <B>xlock</B>  can  appear to hang if it is competing with a high-priority pro-
       cess for the CPU. For example, if <B>xlock</B> is started after a process with
       'nice  -20'  (high  priority),  <B>xlock</B> will take  considerable amount of
       time to respond.

<H2>SHADOW PASSWORDS</H2><PRE>
       If the machine is using a shadow password system, then <B>xlock</B> may not be
       set  up  to  get the real password and so must be given one of its own.
       This can be either on the command line, via the <B>-cpasswd</B> option, or  in
       the  file  <B>$HOME/.xlockrc</B>,  with  the first taking precedence.  In both
       cases an encrypted password is expected (see <B>makekey(8)</B>).   If  neither
       is given, then <B>xlock</B> will prompt for a password and will use that, also
       storing an encrypted version of it in <B>$HOME/.xlockrc</B> for future use.

<H2>XLOCK AND SSH-AGENT</H2><PRE>
       If you use <B>ssh-agent(1)</B> to avoid entering a passphrase every  time  you
       use  one  of  your  <B>ssh(1)</B> private keys, it's good security practice to
       have ssh-agent forget the keys before you  leave  your  terminal  unat-
       tended.   That  way,  an attacker who takes over your terminal won't be
       able to use your private ssh keys to log in to other systems.  Once you
       return  to  your  terminal, you can enter the passphrase and re-add the
       keys to ssh-agent.  There are a couple of ways in which <B>xlock</B> can  help
       to automate this process.  Firstly, the <I>startCmd</I> option allows <B>xlock</B> to
       be configured to run 'ssh-add -D' every time you lock  the  screen,  so
       that  your  keys  are  automatically  deleted  from  ssh-agent.  If the
       <I>that</I> <I>server,</I> <I>and</I> <I>this</I> <I>operation</I> <I>cannot</I> <I>be</I> <I>reversed</I> <I>unless</I> <I>you</I> <I>reset</I> <I>the</I>
       <I>server."</I>            -From the X11R4 Xlib Documentation, Chapter 7.
       NCD  terminals  do  not  allow  xlock  to remove all the hosts from the
       access control list.  Therefore you will need to use the "-remote"  and
       "-allowaccess"  switches.   If you happen to run without "-allowaccess"
       on an NCD terminal, <B>xlock</B> will not work and you will need to reboot the
       terminal,  or  simply  go  into the SETUP menus, under 'Network Parame-
       ters', and turn off TCP/IP access control.
