2 Description
       xlock locks the X server till the user enters  their  password  at  the
       keyboard.   While  xlock  is  running,  all  new server connections are
       refused.  The screen saver is disabled.  The  mouse  cursor  is  turned
       off.   The  screen  is  blanked  and  a  changing pattern is put on the
       screen.  If a key or a  mouse  button  is  pressed  then  the  user  is
       prompted for the password of the user who started xlock.

       If the correct password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the X
       server is restored.  When typing the password Control-U  and  Control-H
       are  active  as  kill  and erase respectively.  To return to the locked
       screen, click in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

       In the lower part of the password screen a  text  is  displayed.   This
       message  is  taken  from  the  first file of the following that exists:
       $HOME/.xlocktext, $HOME/.plan, or $HOME/.signature.

       On systems which support new BSD style authentication, the password may
       be  prefixed  by  an  authentication  style  followed  by a colon (i.e.
       "style:password").  See  the  login.conf(5)  for  more  information  on
       authentication styles.

2 Note on Etiquette
       Xlock  should  not  be  used  on  public terminals when there is a high
       demand for them.

       If you find a public terminal that has been locked by another user  and
       there  are  no  other  terminals available, and the terminal appears to
       have been left idle for a while (normally more than 15 minutes), it  is
       fair to try to reset the session in some manner.

2 Options
       -help
            Print options and a brief description to standard output.

       -version
            Print version number (if >= 4.00) to standard output.

       -resources
            Print default resource file to standard output.

       -display displayname
            The  display option sets the X11 display to lock.  xlock locks all
            available screens on a given server, and restricts you to  locking
            only  a local server such as unix:0, localhost:0, or :0 unless you
            set the -remote option.

       -visual visualname
            visualname which is one  of  "StaticGray",  "GrayScale",  "Static-
            Color",  "PseudoColor",  "TrueColor", "DirectColor", or "default".
            default used to set the screen's default visual (the visual of the
            root window).

       -name resourcename
            resourcename  is  used instead of XLock when looking for resources
            to configure xlock.

       -mode modename

       -delay usecs
            The  delay option sets the speed at which a mode will operate.  It
            simply sets the number of microseconds to delay between batches of
            animations.   In  blank  mode, it is important to set this to some
            small number of seconds, because the keyboard and mouse  are  only
            checked  after  each  delay, so you cannot set the delay too high,
            but a delay of zero would  needlessly  consume  cpu  checking  for
            mouse  and keyboard input in a tight loop, since blank mode has no
            work to do.

            .

            A  negative count allows for randomness.  The range from the mini-
            mum allowed nonnegative count for a particular mode  to  the  ABS(
            count ) (or maximum allowed count , whichever is less).

       -batchcount num
            The  batchcount  option  is  deprecated  but  should still work as
            count.

       -cycles num

            and spiral it is the length of the trail of dots, munch it is  the
            minimum  size of the squares, for kaleid it is the % of black, for
            qix it is the number of lines, for spline -erase it means the num-
            ber  of splines * 64 (for compatibility with +erase), for gears it
            is the number of degrees to increment the spin of  each  gear  by,

       -size num
            The  size option sets the size maximum size of a star in bouboule,
            pyro and star, size of ball in ball and bounce,  size  of  bat  in
            bat,  maximum  size  of  bubble in bubble, size of clock in clock,

            In  flow  and swarm it is the length of the lines.  In atlantis it
            is the shark size.  A negative number allows for randomness, simi-
            lar  to count.  In atunnels, fire, gears, sballs and sproingies it
            is the size of the screen (default 400), this is because  on  many
            slow  systems  it  runs  too slow when the picture covers the full
            screen.  Set to 0 for full screen on fast machines.

       -ncolors num
            The ncolors option sets the maximum number of colors to be used.

       -saturation value
            The saturation option sets saturation of the color  ramp  used  to
            value  .   0 is grayscale and 1 is very rich color.  0.4 is a nice
            pastel.

       -erasemode modename
            As of this writing there are over 12 erase modes supported (if its
            not chosen its assumed random).  The erase modes are random_lines,
            random_squares,  venetian,  triple_wipe,  quad_wipe,  circle_wipe,
            three_circle_wipe,   squaretate,   fizzle,   spiral,  slide_lines,
            losira, no_fade.  modename is now similar to the  option  modelist
            where  you  can  it  can be something like "all-losira" to get all
            erasemodes but losira.  Use a "+" or a "," to add modes like "spi-
            ral+venetian".

       -erasedelay usecs
            The erasedelay option sets the number of microseconds for steps of
            the erasemode (a setting of 0 and the erasemode is bypassed).

       +/-nolock
            The nolock option causes xlock to only draw the patterns  and  not
            lock the display.  A key press or a mouse click will terminate the
            screen saver.

       -/+inwindow
            Runs xlock in a window, so that you can iconify, move,  or  resize
            it  and  still use your screen for other stuff.  When running in a
            window, xlock no longer locks your screen, it just looks good.

       -/+inroot
            Runs xlock in your root window.  Like the inwindow  option  it  no
            longer locks the screen, it just looks good.

       -/+remote
            The  remote option tells xlock to not stop you from locking remote
            X11 servers.  This option should be used with care and is intended
            mainly  to  lock X11 terminals which cannot run xlock locally.  If
            you lock someone else's workstation, they will have to  know  your
            password  to  unlock  it.   Using  +remote  overrides any resource
            derived values for remote and prevents xlock from  being  used  to
            lock  other  X11  servers.   (Use  `+'  instead of `-' to override
            resources for other options that can take the `+'  modifier  simi-
            larly.)

       -/+mono
            The  mono  option  causes  xlock to display monochrome, (black and
            white) pixels rather than the default colored ones on  color  dis-
            plays.

       -/+allowaccess
            This  option is required for servers which do not allow clients to
            modify the host access control list.  It is  also  useful  if  you
            need  to  run  x clients on a server which is locked for some rea-
            son...  When allowaccess is true, the X11 server is left open  for
            clients  to  attach  and thus lowers the inherent security of this
            lock screen.  A side effect of using this option is that if  xlock
            is killed -KILL, the access control list is not lost.

       -vtlock modename
            This  option is used on a XFree86 system to manage VT switching in
            [off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.

       off       means no VT switch locking.

       switch    means VT switch locking + switching to xlock  VT  when  acti-
                 vated.

       restore   means  VT  switch  locking + switching to xlock VT when acti-
                 vated + switching back to previous VT when desactivated.

       noswitch  means VT switch locking only when xlock VT is active.

       -/+allowroot
            The allowroot option allows the root password to unlock the server
            as  well  as  the user who started xlock.  May not be able to turn
            this on and off depending on your system and how xlock was config-
            ured.

       -/+debug
            Allows xlock to be debugged by doing all but locking the screen.

       -/+description
            The description option causes xlock shows a mode description above
            password window.  The default is to show this description.

       -/+echokeys
            The echokeys option causes xlock to echo `?' characters  (default)
            for each key typed into the password prompt.  Some consider this a
            security risk, so the default is to not echo anything.

       -echokey echokey
            The text character to use for echo key in echokeys .

       -/+enablesaver
            By default xlock will disable the normal X server's  screen  saver
            since  it is in effect a replacement for it.  Since it is possible
            to set delay parameters long enough to cause phosphor burn on some
            displays,  this  option will turn back on the default screen saver
            which is very careful to keep most of the screen black.

       -/+resetsaver
            By default xlock will call XResetScreenSaver.  This may  be  unde-
            sirable with DPMS monitors.

       -/+grabmouse
            The  grabmouse option causes xlock to grab the mouse and keyboard,
            this is the default.  xlock can not lock the screen without  this.

       -/+grabserver
            The  grabserver  option  causes xlock to grab the server.  This is
            not usually needed but some unsecure X  servers  can  be  defeated
            without this.

       -/+install
            Allows xlock to install its own colormap if xlock runs out of col-
            ors.  May not work on with some window managers  (fvwm)  and  does
            not work with the -inroot option.

       -/+mousemotion
            Allows  you  to  turn  on  and off the sensitivity to the mouse to
            bring up the password window.

       -/+sound
            Allows you to turn on and off sound if installed with the capabil-
            ity.

       -/+timeelapsed
            Allows  you  to  find  out how long a machine is locked so you can
            complain to an administrator that someone is hogging a machine.

       -/+usefirst
            The usefirst option causes xlock to use the  keystroke  which  got
            you to the password screen as the first character in the password.
            The default is to ignore the first key pressed.

       -/+verbose
            Verbose mode, tells what options it is going to use.

       -nice nicelevel
            The nice option sets system nicelevel  of  the  xlock  process  to
            nicelevel .

       -lockdelay seconds
            The  lockdelay option sets the number of seconds before the screen
            needs a password to be unlocked.  Good for use with an autolocking
            mechanism like xautolock(1).

       -timeout seconds
            The  timeout option sets the number of seconds before the password
            screen will time out.

       -font fontname
            The font option sets the font to be used on the prompt screen.

       -planfont fontname
            option sets the font to be used for the text that is displayed  in
            the lower part of the password screen.

       -fg color
            The fg option sets the color of the text on the password screen to
            color .

       -bg color
            The bg option sets the color of the  background  on  the  password
            screen to color .

       -foreground color
            The  foreground  option sets the color of the text on the password
            screen to color .

       -background color
            The background option sets the color  of  the  background  on  the
            password screen to color .

       -username string
            Text  string is shown in front of user name, defaults to "Name: ".

       -password string
            Text string is the password prompt string, defaults to  "Password:
            ".

       -info string
            Text  string  is an informational message to tell the user what to
            do, defaults to "Enter password to unlock; select icon to  lock.".

       -validate string
            Text  string  is  a  message  shown while validating the password,
            defaults to "Validating login..."

       -invalid string
            Text string is a message shown when password is invalid,  defaults
            to "Invalid login."

       -geometry geom
            The geometry option sets geom the size and offset of the lock win-
            dow (normally the entire screen).  The  entire  screen  format  is
            still  used  for entering the password.  The purpose is to see the
            screen even though it is locked.  This should be used with caution
            since  many  of  the  modes  will fail if the windows are far from
            square or are too small (size must be  greater  than  0x0).   This
            should also be used with -enablesaver to protect screen from phos-
            phor burn.

       -icongeometry geom
            The icongeometry option sets geom the size of  the  iconic  screen
            (normally  64x64) seen when entering the password.  This should be
            used with caution since many of the modes will fail if the windows
            are  far  from  square or are too small (size must be greater than
            0x0).  The greatest size is 256x256.  There should be  some  limit
            so  users  could see who has locked the screen.  Position informa-
            tion of icon is ignored.

       -glgeometry geom
            The glgeometry option sets geom the size  of  the  screen  for  gl
            modes.  Not normally available or needed.

            erator.  Currently used only for marquee and nose modes.

       -messagesfile formatted-filename
            The messagesfile option sets the file to be used  as  the  fortune
            generator.   The  first  entry is the number of fortunes, the next
            line contains the first fortune.  Fortunes begin with a "%%" on  a
            line  by  itself.  Currently used only for marquee and nose modes.
            If one exists, it takes precedence over the fortune program.

       -messagefile filename
            The messagefile option sets the file whose contents are displayed.
            Currently used only for marquee and nose modes.  If one exists, it

            The message option sets the text to be displayed in a mode.   Cur-
            rently used only for flag, marquee and nose modes.  If one exists,
            it takes precedence over the  fortune  program,  messagesfile  and
            message.

       -messagefont fontname
            The messagefont option sets the font to be used in the mode.  Cur-

            with  flag,  image,  life, life1d, maze, or puzzle mode.  For eyes
            and pacman only a xbm file is accepted.  Certain modes reject  the
            bitmap if too big.  /

2 MORE OPTIONS (these may not be available)
       -cpasswd crypted-password
            The  cpasswd  option sets the key to be this text string to unlock
            xlock instead of password file.

       -forceLogout minutes
            The forceLogout option sets minutes to auto-logout.

       -/+dtsaver
            Turn on/off CDE Saver Mode.  This option is only available if  CDE
            support was compiled in.

       -modulepath path
            The modulepath option sets the directories that xlock searches for
            mode modules to load.  It is a colon separated list of directories
            to  search. If "%S" is included in the path, it is replaced by the
            default modulepath.  To add a  private  module  directory  to  the
            default  path,  use something like `%S:~/mymoduledir' as the path.
            This option is only available if module support was compiled in.

            Default sound, female voice: "I am not programmed to give you that
            information."

       -startCmd string
            Text string command to execute when the screen is locked. Commonly
            used instructions include: "zaway". This command, if still running
            when the screensaver exits, will be killed.

       -endCmd string
            Text string command to execute when the screen is unlocked.

       -pipepassCmd string
            Text  string  command  into  which  to  pipe the password when the
            screen is unlocked.

            several automata modes (ant, bug, demon, dilemma, life, loop, vot-
            ers, wator, and wire) (bug and loop do not span this full  range).
            Setting  it  to  0 typically randomizes this, except where bitmaps
            are used (dilemma, life, voters, and wator).

       -/+eyes
            Turn on and off eyes for ant, ant3d, and bug.

       -rule <rule>
            The  rule string is defined as S<neighborhood>/B<neighborhood> for

            all  rules  that  have known patterns; G, picks a random rule from
            all rules that have known gliders.  For life  a  good  example  is
            Conway's   rule   which   is   S23/B3.   Others  are  B36/S23  and
            B3678/S34678.  For life3d good examples are Bay's rules which  are
            S45/B5,  S567/B6, S56/B5, and S67/B67.  The rule string is defined
            as a binary string (requires at least one 1 and one 0) for ant and
            a base 4 (or quadranary) string (requires 3 of 4 digits to be rep-
            resented) for ant3d.  Here a special parameter, T and then a  num-
            ber, will pick a specific table.

            including xpm).  "all3d" will get all the modes that support  this
            option.   "allmouse"  will  get  all  the modes that support mouse
            interaction.  Similarly, "allautomata" for automata  modes,  "all-
            fractal"  for  fractal  modes,  "allgeometry"  for geometry modes,
            "allspace" for space modes.  The random mode  itself  can  not  be
            referenced.

       -/+sequential
            Turn on non-random random option.

**WARNING**
       xlock  can  appear to hang if it is competing with a high-priority pro-
       cess for the CPU. For example, if xlock is started after a process with
       `nice  -20'  (high  priority),  xlock will take  considerable amount of
       time to respond.

2 Shadow Passwords
       If the machine is using a shadow password system, then xlock may not be
       set  up  to  get the real password and so must be given one of its own.
       This can be either on the command line, via the -cpasswd option, or  in
       the  file  $HOME/.xlockrc,  with  the first taking precedence.  In both
       cases an encrypted password is expected (see makekey(8)).   If  neither
       is given, then xlock will prompt for a password and will use that, also
       storing an encrypted version of it in $HOME/.xlockrc for future use.

2 Xlock and Ssh-agent
       If you use ssh-agent(1) to avoid entering a passphrase every  time  you
       use  one  of  your  ssh(1) private keys, it's good security practice to
       have ssh-agent forget the keys before you  leave  your  terminal  unat-
       tended.   That  way,  an attacker who takes over your terminal won't be
       able to use your private ssh keys to log in to other systems.  Once you
       return  to  your  terminal, you can enter the passphrase and re-add the
       keys to ssh-agent.  There are a couple of ways in which xlock can  help
       to automate this process.  Firstly, the startCmd option allows xlock to
       be configured to run `ssh-add -D' every time you lock  the  screen,  so
       that  your  keys  are  automatically  deleted  from  ssh-agent.  If the
       passphrase on your ssh keys is the same as your  password,  then  xlock
       can  also  be  made to re-add the keys to ssh-agent when you unlock the
       screen, via the pipepassCmd option.  This requires a bit of  scripting,
       as  the  command  must  read your password from standard input and then
       automate the interaction with ssh-add to re-add the keys.  There is  an
       example of such a script in the xlock distribution - see etc/xlockssh*

2 Bugs
       "kill  -KILL  xlock " causes the server that was locked to be unusable,
       since all hosts (including localhost) were removed from the access con-
       trol  list  to  lock out new X clients, and since xlock could not catch
       SIGKILL, it terminated before restoring the access control list.   This
       will  leave the X server in a state where "you can no longer connect to
       that server, and this operation cannot be reversed unless you reset the
       server."            -From the X11R4 Xlib Documentation, Chapter 7.
       NCD  terminals  do  not  allow  xlock  to remove all the hosts from the
       access control list.  Therefore you will need to use the "-remote"  and
       "-allowaccess"  switches.   If you happen to run without "-allowaccess"
       on an NCD terminal, xlock will not work and you will need to reboot the
       terminal,  or  simply  go  into the SETUP menus, under `Network Parame-
       ters', and turn off TCP/IP access control.
