.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xlock
locks the X server till the user enters their password at the keyboard.
While
.B xlock
is running,
all new server connections are refused.
The screen saver is disabled.
The mouse cursor is turned off.
The screen is blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen.
If a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted for the
password of the user who started
.BR xlock .

If the correct password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the X
server is restored.  When typing the password Control-U and Control-H are
active as kill and erase respectively.  To return to the locked screen,
click in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

In the lower part of the password screen a text is displayed.  This
message is taken from the first file of the following that exists:
$HOME/.xlocktext, $HOME/.plan, or $HOME/.signature.

On systems which support new BSD style authentication, the password
may be prefixed by an authentication style followed by a colon
(i.e. "style:password").  See the login.conf(5) for more information
on authentication styles.

.SH "NOTE ON ETIQUETTE"
.I Xlock
should not be used on public terminals when there is a high demand for them.

If you find a public terminal that has been locked by another user and
there are no other terminals available, and the terminal appears to have
been left idle for a while (normally more than 15 minutes), it is fair to
try to reset the session in some manner.

.TP 5
.BI \-delay \ usecs
The
.I delay
option sets the speed at which a mode will operate.  It simply sets the
number of microseconds to delay between batches of animations.  In
blank mode, it is important to set this to some small number of seconds,
because the keyboard and mouse are only checked after each delay, so you
cannot set the delay too high, but a delay of zero would needlessly
consume cpu checking for mouse and keyboard input in a tight loop, since
blank mode has no work to do.

.I count
) (or maximum allowed
.I count
, whichever is less).
.TP 5
.BI \-batchcount \ num
The
.I batchcount
option is deprecated but should still work as
.I count.
.TP 5
.BI \-cycles \ num
The
.I cycles

quad_wipe, circle_wipe, three_circle_wipe, squaretate, fizzle, spiral,
slide_lines, losira, no_fade.
.I modename
is now similar to the option

but losira.  Use a "+" or a "," to add modes like "spiral+venetian".
.TP 5
.BI \-erasedelay \ usecs

.I erasedelay
option sets the number of microseconds for steps of the
.B erasemode
(a setting of 0 and the
.B erasemode
is bypassed).
.TP 5
.B +/-nolock
The
.I nolock
option causes
.B xlock
to only draw the patterns and not lock the display.
A key press or a mouse click will terminate the screen saver.
.TP 5
.B -/+inwindow
Runs
.B xlock
in a window, so that you can iconify, move, or resize it and
still use your screen for other stuff.  When running in a window,
.B xlock
no longer locks your screen, it just looks good.
.TP 5
.B -/+inroot
Runs
.B xlock
in your root window.  Like the
.I inwindow
option it no longer locks the screen, it just looks good.
.TP 5
.B -/+remote
The
.I remote
option tells
.B xlock
to not stop you from locking remote X11 servers.  This option should be
used with care and is intended mainly to lock X11 terminals which cannot
run
.B xlock
locally.  If you lock someone else's workstation, they will have to know
.B your
password to unlock it.  Using
.I +remote
overrides any resource derived values for
.I remote
and prevents
.B xlock
from being used to lock other X11 servers.  (Use `+' instead of `-' to
override resources for other options that can take the `+' modifier
similarly.)
.TP 5
.B -/+mono
The
.I mono
option causes
.B xlock
to display monochrome, (black and white) pixels rather than the default
colored ones on color displays.
.TP 5
.B -/+allowaccess
This option is required for servers which do not allow clients to modify
the host access control list.  It is also useful if you need to run x
clients on a server which is locked for some reason...  When
.I allowaccess
is true, the X11 server is left open for clients to attach and thus
lowers the inherent security of this lock screen.  A side effect of using
this option is that if
.B xlock
is killed -KILL, the access control list is not lost.
.TP 5
.BI \-vtlock \ modename
This option is used on a XFree86 system to manage VT switching in
[off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.
.TP 10
.I off
means no VT switch locking.
.TP 10
.I switch
means VT switch locking + switching to xlock VT when activated.
.TP 10
.I restore
means VT switch locking + switching to xlock VT when activated +
switching back to previous VT when desactivated.
.TP 10
.I noswitch
means VT switch locking only when xlock VT is active.
.TP 5
.B -/+allowroot
The
.I allowroot
option allows the root password to unlock the server as well as the user
who started
.BR xlock .
May not be able to turn this on and off depending on your system and how
.B xlock
was configured.
.TP 5
.B -/+debug
Allows
.B xlock
to be debugged by doing all but locking the screen.
.TP 5
.B -/+description
The
.I description
option causes
.B xlock
shows a mode description above password window.  The default is to
show this description.
.TP 5
.B -/+echokeys
The
.I echokeys
option causes
.B xlock
to echo '?' characters (default) for each key typed into the password prompt.
Some consider this a security risk, so the default is to not echo
anything.
.TP 5
.BI \-echokey \ echokey
The text character to use for echo key in
.I echokeys .
.TP 5
.B -/+enablesaver
By default
.B xlock
will disable the normal X server's screen saver since
it is in effect a replacement for it.  Since it is possible to set delay
parameters long enough to cause phosphor burn on some displays, this
option will turn back on the default screen saver which is very careful
to keep most of the screen black.
.TP 5
.B -/+resetsaver
By default
.B xlock
will call XResetScreenSaver.  This may be undesirable with DPMS monitors.
.TP 5
.B -/+grabmouse
The
.I grabmouse
option causes
.B xlock
to grab the mouse and keyboard, this is the default.
.B xlock
can not lock the screen without this.
.TP 5
.B -/+grabserver
The
.I grabserver
option causes
.B xlock
to grab the server.  This is not usually needed but some unsecure X servers
can be defeated without this.
.TP 5
.B -/+install
Allows
.B xlock
to install its own colormap if
.B xlock
runs out of colors.
May not work on with some window managers (fvwm) and does not work with
the -inroot option.
.TP 5
.B -/+mousemotion
Allows you to turn on and off the sensitivity to the mouse to bring up
the password window.
.TP 5
.B -/+sound
Allows you to turn on and off sound if installed with the capability.
.TP 5
.B -/+timeelapsed
Allows you to find out how long a machine is locked so you can complain
to an administrator that someone is hogging a machine.
.TP 5
.B -/+usefirst
The
.I usefirst
option causes
.B xlock
to use the keystroke which got you to the password screen as the first
character in the password.  The default is to ignore the first key
pressed.
.TP 5
.B -/+verbose
Verbose mode, tells what options it is going to use.
.TP 5
.BI \-nice \ nicelevel
The
.I nice
option sets system nicelevel of the
.B xlock
process to
.I nicelevel .
.TP 5

The
.I lockdelay
option sets the number of
.I seconds
before the screen needs a password to be unlocked.  Good for use with
an autolocking mechanism like xidle(1).

.BI \-timeout \ seconds
The
.I timeout
option sets the number of
.I seconds
before the password screen will time out.
.TP 5
.BI \-font \ fontname
The
.I font
option sets the font to be used on the prompt screen.
.TP 5

"Validating login..."
.TP 5
.BI \-invalid \ string
Text

"Invalid login."
.TP 5
.BI \-geometry \ geom
The
.I geometry
option sets
.I geom
the size and offset of the lock window (normally the entire screen).
The entire screen format is still used for entering the password.  The
purpose is to see the screen even though it is locked.  This should be
used with caution since many of the modes will fail if the windows
are far from square or are too small (size must be greater than 0x0).
This should also be used with -enablesaver to protect screen from
phosphor burn.
.TP 5
.BI \-icongeometry \ geom
The
.I icongeometry
option sets
.I geom
the size of the iconic screen (normally 64x64) seen when entering the
password.  This should be used with caution since many of the modes will
fail if the windows are far from square or are too small (size must be
greater than 0x0).  The greatest size is 256x256.  There should be some
limit so users could see who has locked the screen.  Position
information of icon is ignored.
.TP 5
.BI \-glgeometry \ geom
The
.I glgeometry
option sets
.I geom
the size of the screen for gl modes.  Not normally available or needed.

.SH **WARNING**
.B xlock
can appear to hang if it is competing with a high-priority process for
the CPU. For example, if
.B xlock
is started after a process with 'nice -20'
(high priority),
.B xlock
will take  considerable amount of time to respond.
.sp
.SH "SHADOW PASSWORDS"
If the machine is using a shadow password system, then
.B xlock
may not be set up to get the real password and so must be given one
of its own. This can be either on the command line, via the
.B -cpasswd
option,
or in the file
.BR $HOME/.xlockrc ,
with the first taking precedence.  In both cases an encrypted password
is expected (see makekey(8)).  If neither is given, then
.B xlock
will prompt for a password and will use that, also storing an
encrypted version of it in
.B $HOME/.xlockrc
for future use.
.sp
.SH "XLOCK AND SSH-AGENT"
If you use ssh-agent(1) to avoid entering a passphrase every time you use
one of your ssh(1) private keys, it's good security practice to have
ssh-agent forget the keys before you leave your terminal unattended.  That
way, an attacker who takes over your terminal won't be able to use your
private ssh keys to log in to other systems.  Once you return to your
terminal, you can enter the passphrase and re-add the keys to ssh-agent.
There are a couple of ways in which
.B xlock
can help to automate this process.  Firstly, the
.I startCmd
option allows
.B xlock
to be configured to run 'ssh-add -D' every time you lock the screen, so
that your keys are automatically deleted from ssh-agent.  If the
passphrase on your ssh keys is the same as your password, then
.B xlock
can also be made to re-add the keys to ssh-agent when you unlock the
screen, via the
.I pipepassCmd
option.  This requires a bit of scripting, as the command must read your
password from standard input and then automate the interaction with
ssh-add to re-add the keys.  There is an example of such a script in the
.B xlock
distribution - see
.I etc/xlockssh*
.sp
.SH BUGS
"kill -KILL
.B xlock
" causes the server that was locked to be unusable, since all hosts
(including localhost) were removed from the access control list
to lock out new X clients, and since
.B xlock
could not catch SIGKILL, it terminated before restoring the access
control list.  This will leave the X server in a state where
\fI"you can no longer connect to that server,
and this operation cannot be reversed unless you reset the server."\fP
		-From the X11R4 Xlib Documentation, Chapter 7.
.br
NCD terminals do not allow xlock to remove all the hosts from the access
control list.  Therefore you will need to use the "-remote" and
"-allowaccess" switches.  If you happen to run without "-allowaccess" on an
NCD terminal,
.B xlock
will not work and you will need to reboot the terminal, or simply go into
the SETUP menus, under 'Network Parameters', and turn off TCP/IP access
control.
