This is for getting xlockmore modes running in xscreensaver-2.17.
xlockmore-modes will install first ...
So during an installation these executables will be overwritten
if there is a conflict with the xscreensavers modes.

See docs/TODO for current problems.

0. OK say you have xscreensaver-2.17/ .  Drop xlockmore in that directory
   change the name of xlockmore to "xlockmore".
   (This is not 100% tested so it would be wise to read it first!)

      cd xscreensaver-2.17/xlockmore/xscreensaver

1. Makefile.in replaces ../../Makefile.in
   configure.in replaces ../../configure.in
   need autoconf to replace configure... (pick it from your favorite gnu site)

      mv ../../configure.in ../../configure.in.orig
      mv ../../Makefile.in ../../Makefile.in.orig
      cp ./configure.in ../../configure.in
      cp ./Makefile.in ../../Makefile.in
      cd ../..
      autoconf
      cd xlockmore/xscreensaver

2. modes/glx directory goes in xscreensaver/hacks/glx with the old
   Makefile.in (do not write over this file!) and xlock-gl.c

      mv ../../hacks/glx ../../hacks/glx.orig
      cp -R ../modes/glx ../../hacks/glx
      cp ../../hacks/glx.orig/Makefile.in ../../hacks/glx/
      cp ../../hacks/glx.orig/xlock-gl.c ../../hacks/glx/


3. change Makefiles... make backups

     cp ../xlock/Makefile.in ../xlock/Makefile.inxl
     cp ../modes/Makefile.in ../modes/Makefile.inxl
     cp ../xlock/Makefile.inxs ../xlock/Makefile.in
     cp ../modes/Makefile.inxs ../modes/Makefile.in


4. Then its all ready...

     cd ../..
     configure
     make
