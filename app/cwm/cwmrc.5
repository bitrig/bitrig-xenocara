.Sh NAME
.Nm cwmrc
.Nd calm window manager configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr cwm 1
window manager configuration file format.
.Sh OPTIONS
There are quite a few settings that affect the operation of
.Xr cwm 1 .
.Pp
The following options are accepted in the configuration file:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic fontname Ar font
Makes the
.Xr Xft 3
font string
.Ar font
the default font.
.It Ic sticky Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
Set sticky group mode on.
The default behavior for new windows is to not assign any group.
This changes the default behavior to assigning the currrently selected
group to any newly created windows.
.It Ic command Ar name Ar path
Every command entry is shown in the application menu.
When it is selected, the image is executed with
.Xr execve 2 .
.Pp
The entries
.Nm term
and
.Nm lock
have a special meaning.
When they exist they point to the terminal program and screen locking
programs used by the keybindings specified above.
The defaults for these are
.Xr xterm 1
and
.Xr xlock 1 ,
respectively.
.It Ic autogroup Ar group Dq windowclass
.It Ic autogroup Ar group Dq windowclass,windowname
Autogroups are read upon startup and control the
automatic grouping feature, which is based on the window name and class
properties.
The group is a number between 1 and 9.
.Pp
To obtain the name and class of a window, use
.Ql xprop WM_CLASS ,
then click on the window.
The first quoted string is the window name; the second one is the
window class.
.Pp
For example, to make all windows in the
.Xr xterm 1
class go to the third group:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
autogroup 3 XTerm
.Ed
.It Ic ignore Ar program
Ignore programs by that name by not drawing borders around them.
For example the command
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ignore xclock
.Ed
will cause any instances of
.Xr xclock 1
to not have borders.
.It Ic bind Ar keys Ar command
Cause the creation of keyboard shortcuts.
The default shortcuts will always be created.
In case of conflict, user-defined shortcuts take precidence.
The modifier keys come first, followed by a ``-''.
The following modifiers are recognised:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa C
The Control key.
.It Pa M
The Meta key.
.It Pa S
The Shift key.
.It Pa 2
The Mod2 key.
.It Pa 3
The Mod3 key.
.It Pa 4
The Mod4 key (normally the windows key).
.El
The ``-'' should be followed by either a keysym name, taken from
.Pa /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h ,
or a numerical keycode value enclosed in ``[]''.
The command should be either the name of a task from the
``name_to_kbfunc''
structure in
.Pa conf.c ,
or, alternatively it should be the commandline that is wished to be executed.
A special case is the ``unmap'' keyword, which causes any bindings using the
named shortcut to be removed.
This can be used to remove a binding which conflicts with an application.
.Pp
For example, to cause
.Ic C-M-r
to add a label to a window:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind CM-r "label"
.Ed
.Pp
Launch an xterm running
.Xr top 1
with C-S-Enter:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind CS-Return "/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e top"
.Ed
.Pp
Remove a keybinding for Mod4-o
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind 4-o "unmap"
.Ed
.It Ic gap Ar top bottom left right
Define "gaps" at the edge of the screen, so that when a window is maximized it will not overlap this area.
This gap can be used for other applications such as
.Xr xclock 1 ,
which the user may wish to remain visible.
.Pp
.Pa top bottom left
and
.Pa right
are the sizes of each the gap in pixels.
