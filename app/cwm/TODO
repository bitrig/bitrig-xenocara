- clean up menu code from 9wm

- window initial position

- don't map windows if it's within [some time increment] of active typing,
  this is part of the "calm" goal.  also, it helps if you're mindlessly
  typing in a password and the keyboard input ends up in some other window,
  bad...

- integrate everything into /ONE/ event loop.
  register handlers, with the ability to select, for example,
  a window, or an event, etc.  (no, maybe not...)

- ignoreq, always lower them.  perhaps implement by lowering the entire 
  queue on each XLower...

- kbd shortcut for xlock

- search window should try to stay inside of the screen boundaries.

- geographical keyboard navigation (window switching)

- search should ignore the current window. (not add to match list).

- make kbd shortcuts/events more general.  the ability to associate an
  event with a mode (i.e. prioritize).  gets rid of hacky-ness in
  groups, etc.

- figure out what's up when alt-tab goes back to the current window
  once before moving on.

- cache all the atoms somewhere.

- convert globals from G_foo to Foo;
