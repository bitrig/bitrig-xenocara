Move current window.
.It Ic CM-M1
Toggle group membership of current window.
.It Ic M-M2

.Pp
The options for
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
By default,
.Nm
loads
.Pa ~/.cwmrc ,
if present.
Any error messages from lines in the configuration file will be sent to
.Em stderr ;
however,
.Nm
will continue to process the rest of the configuration file.
.It Fl d Ar display
Specify the display to use.
.El
.Sh POINTER MOVEMENT
The pointer can be moved with the use of the keyboard through bindings.
.Ic C-[Up|Down|Left|Right]
moves the pointer a small amount, while
.Ic CS-[Up|Down|Left|Right]
moves the pointer a larger amount.
For example, to move the pointer to the left by a small amount,
press
.Ic C-Left .
To move the pointer down by a larger amount, press
.Ic CS-Down .
.Sh WINDOW MOVEMENT AND RESIZING
.Nm
windows can be moved with the use of the keyboard through
.Cm vi Ns -like
bindings.
.Ic M-[hjkl]
moves the current window a small amount, while
.Ic MS-[hjkl]
moves the current window a larger amount.
For example, to move the current window to the left a small amount, press
.Ic M-h .
To move the current window down by a larger amount, press
.Ic MS-j .
.Pp
Similarly, windows may be resized with the same key bindings with the addition
of the Control key.
.Ic CM-[hjkl]
resizes the window a small amount and
.Ic CMS-[hjkl]
resizes by a larger increment.
.Sh SEARCH
.Nm
features the ability to search for windows by their current title,
old titles, and by their label.
The priority for the search results are: label, current title,
old titles in reverse order, and finally window class name.
.Nm
keeps a history of the 5 previous titles of a window.
.Pp
When searching, the leftmost character of the result list may show a
flag:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset indent -compact
.It !
The window is the currently focused window.
.It &
The window is hidden.
.El
.Pp
The following key bindings may be used to navigate the result list:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "[Down] or C-s or M-j" -offset indent -compact
.It Ic [Down], C-s No or Ic M-j
Select the next window in the list.
.It Ic [Up], C-r No or Ic M-k
Select the previous window in the list.
.It Ic [Backspace] No or Ic C-h
Backspace.
.It Ic C-u
Clear the input.
.It Ic [Return]
Focus the selected window.
.It Ic [Esc]
Cancel.
.It Ic C-a
Whenever there are no matching windows, list every window.
.El
.Sh GROUPS
.Nm
has the ability to group windows together, and use the groups to
perform operations on the entire group instead of just one window.
Currently, the only operation that is supported is to hide and unhide
the grouped windows.
Together with the
.Pa sticky
option, this can be used to emulate virtual desktops.
.Pp
To edit groups, use the group selection commands to toggle membership
of a group.
A blue border will be shown briefly on windows added to the current group,
and a red border will be shown on those just removed.
.Sh MENUS
Menus are recalled by clicking the mouse on the root window:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset indent -compact
.It Ic M1
Show list of currently hidden windows.
Clicking on an item will unhide that window.
.It Ic M2
Show list of currently defined groups.
Clicking on an item will hide/unhide that group.
.It Ic M3
Show list of applications as defined in
.Pa ~/.cwmrc .
Clicking on an item will spawn that application.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "DISPLAYXXX"
.It DISPLAY

.Fl d
option is given.
.El
.Sh FILES

.It Pa ~/.cwmrc
.El

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was originally inspired by evilwm, but was rewritten from scratch
due to limitations in the evilwm codebase.
The from-scratch rewrite borrowed some code from 9wm, however that code
has since been removed or rewritten.
