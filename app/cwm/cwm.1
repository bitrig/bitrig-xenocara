.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a window manager for X11.
It was originally inspired by evilwm, but was rewritten from scratch
due to limitations in the evilwm codebase.
The from-scratch rewrite borrowed some code from 9wm.
.Nm
contains many new features which all concentrate on the efficiency and
transparency of window management.  
.Nm
also aims to maintain the most simplest and pleasant aesthetic.

The default behavior for new windows is to not assign any group.
This changes the default behavior to assigning the currrently selected
group to any newly created windows.
.It Fl f Ar fontname
Makes the 
.Xr Xft 3
font string
.Ar fontname
the default font.
.El
.Sh SEARCH
.Nm 
features the ability to search for windows by their current title, old
titles and by their label.
The priority for the search results are: Label, current title, old
titles in reverse order and finally window class name.
.Nm
keeps a history of the 5 previous titles of a window.
.Pp
When searching, the leftmost character of the result list may show a
flag:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset -indent -compact
.It Fa !
The window is the currently focused window.
.It Fa &
The window is hidden.
.El
.Pp
The following keybindings may be used to navigate the result list:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset -indent -compact
.It [Down] or C-s
Select the next window in the list.
.It [Up] or C-r
Select the previous window in the list.
.It C-u
Clear the input.
.It [Enter]
Focus the selected window.
.It [Esc]
Quit.
.It C-a
Whenever there are no matching windows, list every window.
.El
.Sh GROUPS
.Nm
has the ability to group windows together, and use the groups to
perform operations on the entire group instead of just one window.
Currently, the only operation that is supported is to hide and unhide
the grouped windows.
Together with the
.Fl s
option, this can be used to emulate virtual desktops.
.Pp
To edit groups, enter the group edit mode, and select/unselect the
groups with the group selection mouse click.
A blue border will be shown on the currently selected windows.
The group selection keyboard shortcuts can also be used to change
which group to edit.
.Sh MENUS
Menus are recalled by clicking the mouse on the root window:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset -indent -compact
.It Fa M1
Show list of currently hidden windows.
Clicking on an item will unhide that window.
.It Fa M2
Show list of currently defined groups.
Clicking on an item will hide/unhide that group.
.It Fa M3
Show list of applications as defined in 
.Fa ~/.calmwm .
Clicking on an item will spawn that application.  
.El
.Sh ~/.calmwm
Any directory entries here are shown in the application menu.
When it is selected, the image is executed with
.Xr execve 2 .
One use of this is to create symbolic links for your favorite
applications in this directory using 
.Xr ln 1 .
.Pp
The entries
.Nm term
and 
.Nm lock
have special meaning.
When they exist they point to the terminal program and screen locking
programs used by the keybindings specified above.
The defaults for these are 
.Xr xterm 1
and 
.Xr xlock 1 ,
respectively.
