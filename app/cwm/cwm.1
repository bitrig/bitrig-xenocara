.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a window manager for X11.
It was originally inspired by evilwm, but was rewritten from scratch
due to limitations in the evilwm codebase.
The from-scratch rewrite borrowed some code from 9wm.
.Nm
contains many new features which all concentrate on the efficiency and
transparency of window management.
.Nm
also aims to maintain the simplest and most pleasant aesthetic.

.Nm
is very simple in its use.
Most of the actions are initiated via keybindings.

This parses
.Pa $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
to provide host auto-completion.
.Xr ssh 1
will be executed via the configured terminal emulator.
.El
.Pp
The mouse bindings are also important, they are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It M-M1
Move a window.
.It C-M-M1
Toggle a window's membership in the current group.
A blue highlight indicates the window has been added to the group;
a red highlight indicates it has been removed.
.It M-M2
Resize a window/select a window.
.It M-M3
Lower a window.
.El
.Pp
The options for
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar display
Specify the display to use.
.It Fl f Ar fontname
Makes the
.Xr Xft 3
font string
.Ar fontname
the default font.
.It Fl s
Set sticky group mode on.
The default behavior for new windows is to not assign any group.
This changes the default behavior to assigning the currrently selected
group to any newly created windows.
.El
.Sh WINDOW MOVEMENT
.Nm
windows can be moved with the use of the keyboard through Vi-like bindings.
M-[hjkl] moves the current window a small amount, while M-shift-[hjkl] moves
the current window a larger amount.
For example, to move the current window to the left a small amount, press M-h.
To move the current window down by a larger amount, press M-shift-j.
.Sh SEARCH
.Nm
features the ability to search for windows by their current title,
old titles, and by their label.
The priority for the search results are: label, current title,
old titles in reverse order, and finally window class name.
.Nm
keeps a history of the 5 previous titles of a window.
.Pp
When searching, the leftmost character of the result list may show a
flag:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset -indent -compact
.It !
The window is the currently focused window.
.It &
The window is hidden.
.El
.Pp
The following keybindings may be used to navigate the result list:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "[Down] or C-sXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Ic [Down] No or Ic C-s
Select the next window in the list.
.It Ic [Up] No or Ic C-r
Select the previous window in the list.
.It Ic C-u
Clear the input.
.It Ic [Enter]
Focus the selected window.
.It Ic [Esc]
Quit.
.It Ic C-a
Whenever there are no matching windows, list every window.
.El
.Sh GROUPS
.Nm
has the ability to group windows together, and use the groups to
perform operations on the entire group instead of just one window.
Currently, the only operation that is supported is to hide and unhide
the grouped windows.
Together with the
.Fl s
option, this can be used to emulate virtual desktops.
.Pp
To edit groups, enter the group edit mode, and select/unselect the
groups with the group selection mouse click.
A blue border will be shown on the currently selected windows.
The group selection keyboard shortcuts can also be used to change
which group to edit.
.Sh MENUS
Menus are recalled by clicking the mouse on the root window:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset -indent -compact
.It M1
Show list of currently hidden windows.
Clicking on an item will unhide that window.
.It M2
Show list of currently defined groups.
Clicking on an item will hide/unhide that group.
.It M3
Show list of applications as defined in
.Pa ~/.calmwm .
Clicking on an item will spawn that application.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "DISPLAYXXX"
.It DISPLAY
.Nm
starts on this display unless the
.Fl d
option is given.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa ~/.calmwm
Any directory entries here are shown in the application menu.
When it is selected, the image is executed with
.Xr execve 2 .
One use of this is to create symbolic links for your favorite
applications in this directory using
.Xr ln 1 .
.Pp
The entries
.Nm term
and
.Nm lock
have a special meaning.
When they exist they point to the terminal program and screen locking
programs used by the keybindings specified above.
The defaults for these are
.Xr xterm 1
and
.Xr xlock 1 ,
respectively.
.It Pa ~/.calmwm/.autogroup
Symlinks in this directory are read upon startup and control the
automatic grouping feature, which is based on the window name and class
properties.
To obtain the name and class of a window, use
.Ql xprop WM_CLASS ,
then click on the window.
The first quoted string is the window name; the second one is the
window class.
.Pp
The name of a link can be the window class, or the window class and name
separated by a comma.
The link target is a group name (one, two, \&..., nine).
For example, to make all windows in the
.Xr xterm 1
class go to the third group:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ln -s three ~/.calmwm/.autogroup/XTerm
