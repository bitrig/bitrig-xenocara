The xinit program is used to start the X Window System server and a first
client program on systems that are not using a display manager such as xdm.

The xinit is not intended for naive users.  Instead, site administrators should
design user-friendly scripts that present the desired interface when starting
up X.  The startx script is one such example.  

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
Xorg mailing list:
