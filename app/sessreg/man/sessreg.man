.SH NAME
sessreg \- manage utmp/wtmp entries for non-init clients
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sessreg
[-w \fIwtmp-file\fP]
[-u \fIutmp-file\fP]
[-L \fIlastlog-file\fP]
[-l \fIline-name\fP]
[-h \fIhost-name\fP]
[-s \fIslot-number\fP]
[-x \fIXservers-file\fP]
[-t \fIttys-file\fP]
[-a]
[-d]
\fIuser-name\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fISessreg\fP is a simple program for managing utmp/wtmp and lastlog
entries for xdm sessions.
.PP
System V has a better interface to utmp than BSD; it
dynamically allocates entries in the file, instead of writing them at fixed
positions indexed by position in
.BR __ttys_file__ .
.PP
To manage BSD-style utmp files, \fIsessreg\fP has two strategies.  In
conjunction with xdm, the -x option counts the number of lines in
.B __ttys_file__
and then adds to that the number of the line in the Xservers file which
specifies the display.  The display name must be specified as the
"line-name" using the -l option.  This sum is used as the "slot-number" in
the utmp file that this entry will be written at.  In the more general case,
the -s option specifies the slot-number directly.  If for some strange reason
your system uses a file other than
.B __ttys_file__
to manage init, the -t option can direct
\fIsessreg\fP to look elsewhere for a count of terminal sessions.
.PP
Conversely, System V managers will not ever need to use these options (-x,
-s and -t).  To make the program easier to document and explain,
\fIsessreg\fP accepts the BSD-specific flags in the System V
environment and ignores them.
.PP
BSD and Linux also have a host-name field in the utmp file which doesn't
exist in System V.  This option is also ignored by the System V version of
\fIsessreg\fP.
.SH USAGE
.PP
In Xstartup, place a call like:
.nf

       sessreg -a -l $DISPLAY -x /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers $USER

.fi
and in Xreset:
.nf

       sessreg -d -l $DISPLAY -x /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers $USER
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-w\fP \fIwtmp-file\fP"
This specifies an alternate wtmp file, instead of
.BR __wtmp_file__ .
The special name "none" disables writing records to the wtmp file.
.IP "\fB-u\fP \fIutmp-file\fP"
This specifies an alternate utmp file, instead of
.BR __utmp_file__ .
The special name "none" disables writing records to the utmp file.
.IP "\fB-L\fP \fIlastlog-file\fP"
This specifies an alternate lastlog file, instead of
.BR __lastlog_file__ ,
if the platform supports lastlog files.
The special name "none" disables writing records to the lastlog file.
.IP "\fB-l\fP \fIline-name\fP"
This describes the "line" name of the entry.  For terminal sessions,
this is the final pathname segment of the terminal device filename
(e.g. ttyd0).  For X sessions, it should probably be the local display name
given to the users session (e.g. :0).  If none is specified, the
terminal name will be determined with ttyname(__libmansuffix__) and stripped of leading
components.
.IP "\fB-h\fP \fIhost-name\fP"
This is set for BSD hosts to indicate that the session was initiated from
a remote host.  In typical xdm usage, this options is not used.
.IP "\fB-s\fP \fIslot-number\fP"
Each potential session has a unique slot number in BSD systems, most are
identified by the position of the \fIline-name\fP in the
.BR __ttys_file__ file.
This option overrides the default position determined with ttyslot(__libmansuffix__).
This option is inappropriate for use with xdm, the -x option is more useful.
.IP "\fB-x\fP \fIXservers-file\fP"
As X sessions are one-per-display, and each display is entered in this file,
this options sets the \fIslot-number\fP to be the number of lines in
the \fIttys-file\fP plus the index into this file that the \fIline-name\fP
is found.
.IP "\fB-t\fP \fIttys-file\fP"
This specifies an alternate file which the \fI-x\fP option will use to count
the number of terminal sessions on a host.
.IP "\fB-a\fP"
This session should be added to utmp/wtmp.
.IP "\fB-d\fP"
This session should be deleted from utmp/wtmp.  One of -a/-d must
be specified.
