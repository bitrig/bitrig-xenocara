.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility for reading, writing and displaying streams of raw video frames.
By default frames are read from
.Ar file
and displayed via
.Xr Xv 3 .
The default
.Ar file
is
.Pa /dev/video .
If the
.Fl o
option is used frames are read from
.Ar file
and written to
.Ar output .
If the
.Fl i
option is used frames are read from
.Ar input
and displayed via
.Xr Xv 3 .
If the
.Fl O
option is used frames are read from
.Ar file ,
written to
.Ar output
and displayed via
.Xr Xv 3 .
The acutance, brightness, contrast, gain, gamma, hue and saturation
controls of
.Ar file
can also be adjusted if
.Ar file
supports these controls.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-a adaptor"
.It Fl a Ar adaptor
Index of
.Xr Xv 3
adaptor to use.
The default is 0, the first adaptor reported by
.Xr X 7 .
.It Fl e Ar encoding
Lowercase FOURCC name of video encoding to use.
Valid arguments are
.Ql uyvy
and
.Ql yuy2 .
The default is
.Ql yuy2
unless
.Ar file
is being used and only supports
.Ql uyvy ,
in which case
.Ql uyvy
will be used by default.
.It Fl f Ar file
.Xr video 4
device from which frames will be read.
The default is
.Pa /dev/video .
.It Fl i Ar input
File from which frames will be read.
If
.Ar input
is
.Ql - ,
frames will be read from standard input.
.It Fl O Ar output
File to which frames will be written.
If
.Ar output
is
.Ql - ,
frames will be written to standard output.
In contrast to
.Fl o ,
if this option is used,
.Nm
will also display the frames via
.Xr Xv 3 .
.It Fl o Ar output
File to which frames will be written.
If
.Ar output
is
.Ql - ,
frames will be written to standard output.
.It Fl R
Disable frame rate adjustment.
.It Fl r Ar rate
Rate in frames per second at which to read.
Must be an integer greater than 0.
If the
.Fl r
option is not specified, frames will be read as quickly as possible.
If reading from a
.Xr video 4
device, the device's frame rate will be set to the frame rate the device
supports that is closest to
.Ar rate .
Frames will be read as quickly as they are available from the device, but
will be displayed and/or written to
.Ar output
at the rate specified, unless the
.Fl R
option is used.
.It Fl s Ar size
Size of frames to read.
The format of
.Ar size
is WxH, where W represents width and H represents height, both expressed
as number of pixels.
The default is 640x480.
If
.Ar size
does not contain
.Ql x ,
.Ar size
is interpreted as only the width.
If
.Ql x
is the first character of
.Ar size ,
the characters following
.Ql x
are interpreted as the height.
If only one of width or height is specified, the other will be calculated
using a 4:3 width:height ratio.
For example, if given
.Ql -s 640
.Nm
will use a size of
.Ql 640x480 .
When reading from a
.Xr video 4
device and displaying the frames on an
.Xr Xv 3
display, this option also accepts two special strings,
.Ql half
and
.Ql full.
If either
.Ql half
or
.Ql full
are specified,
.Nm
will read frames that are no larger than 2/3 the display width and
2/3 the display height.
If
.Ql full
is specified,
.Nm
will stretch the frame to the full size of the display using
.Xr Xv 3
scaling.
If
.Nm
is reading frames from a
.Xr video 4
device and the frame size does not match a frame size the device supports,
.Nm
will use the largest frame size supported by the device that is smaller
than the specified size.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Multiple instances of this option are allowed.
Each instance increases the level of informational output printed to
.Ar stderr .
.El
.Pp
.Nm
will quit reading frames and exit nicely if it receives any of
the following signals: SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGPIPE.
.Pp
.Nm
responds to certain key presses while it is displaying frames.
The keypresses are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "aXX"
.It Ic A
Increase acutance (sharpness) control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic a
Decrease acutance (sharpness) control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic B
Increase brightness control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic b
Decrease brightness control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic C
Increase contrast control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic c
Decrease contrast control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic f
Toggle full-screen display.
.It Ic G
Increase gain control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic g
Decrease gain control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic H
Increase hue control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic h
Decrease hue control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic M
Increase gamma control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic m
Decrease gamma control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic O
Start writing to
.Ar output .
Only meaningful when the
.Fl O
option is used.
.It Ic o
Stop writing to
.Ar output .
Only meaningful when the
.Fl O
option is used.
.It Ic p
Toggle new frame display.
.It Ic q
Quit
.Nm .
.It Ic r
Reset all supported controls of
.Ar file
to their default value.
.It Ic S
Increase saturation control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic s
Decrease saturation control of
.Ar file .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will read YUY2 encoded, 640 pixel wide and 480 pixel
high video frames from
.Ar /dev/video
and display them using the default
.Xr Xv 3
adaptor:
.Pp
.Dl "$ video"
.Pp
The following command will read YUY2 encoded, 640 pixel wide and 480 pixel
high video frames from
.Ar /dev/video
and write them to
.Ar video.raw
at a rate of 15 frames per second:
.Pp
.Dl "$ video -r 15 -o video.raw"
.Pp
The following command will read YUY2 encoded, 640 pixel wide and 480 pixel
high video frames from
.Ar /dev/video ,
write them to
.Ar video.raw
and display them using the default
.Xr Xv 3
adaptor at a rate of 15 frames per second:
.Pp
.Dl "$ video -r 15 -O video.raw"
.Pp
The following command will read YUY2 encoded, 640 pixel wide and 480 pixel
high video frames from
.Ar video.raw
and display them on the default
.Xr Xv 3
adaptor at a rate of 15 frames per second:
.Pp
.Dl "$ video -r 15 -i video.raw"
.Pp
Note that with the first three commands, if
.Ar /dev/video
does not support 640x480 pixels sized frames, the largest frame size
smaller than 640x480 will be used, and if
.Ar /dev/video
does not support yuy2 encoding, uyvy will be used.
