Bugs found with xbench
----------------------
Lines, FillStyle Solid, Planemask 0, LineWidth 0 - draws lines anyways.
  other FillStyles work correctly.
Rectangles - same problem.
Filled Rectangles, FillStyle other than OpaqueStippled, Planemask 0 - draws
  rectangles anyways.
  OpaqueStippled works fine.
Dashed Lines - sometimes hangs.
  only happens when lots of lines/short dashes/long lines.
Lines, Function equiv, LineWidth > 1 - copies instead of equiving.
