.Sh NAME
.Nm xtsscale
.Nd X touch screen calibration tool 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm xtsscale
.Bk -words
.Op Ar device
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used interactively to calculate both the scaling and offset values which
will make the pointer act at the indicated location on the screen.
.Pp
.Ar device 
is the name or numerical identifier of the X Input extension device 
to calibrate.
Use
.Pp
.Dl # xinput --list
.Pp
to figure out the actual name for the X configuration.
.Ar device
can be omitted if there is only one X extension pointer in the system.
.Pp
When good deviations are calculated from the selections made at these
points,
.Nm
will exit and provide on standard output a result like the following:
.Pp
.Dl mouse.scale=200,3400,312,3672,0,1024,768
.Pp
This result should be placed into
.Pa /etc/wsconsctl.conf
for further use, or can be immediately applied using:
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl mouse.scale=200,3400,312,3672,0,1024,768
.Sh NOTES
To use 
.Nm
the mode of the raw mode of the input device should be set in the
.Pa /etc/X11/xorg.conf
X configuration file. See 
.Xr ws 4
for details.
.Pp
.Pa /etc/wsconsctl.conf
cannot currently be used to set the calibration data of a device
that is not the first device. (
.Pa /dev/wsmouse0
)
