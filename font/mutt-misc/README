Version: 1.9
22 November 2002

This set of fonts provides a 12pt, 100dpi proportional font with many of
the glyphs needed for Unicode text.  I call the typeface "ClearlyU" and
it was influenced by Donald Knuth's Computer Modern.

The fonts together contain 9538 glyphs at the moment.  This does not include
cuarabic12.bdf and cudevnag12.bdf which contain glyphs from cu12.bdf and and
cu-pua12.bdf.

Information about this font and samples, are located at:
