	Notes on building Xenocara for OpenBSD X hackers

This document presents some techniques that can be useful for people
wanting to hack the xenocara tree. It assumes some basic knowledge of
the OpenBSD build system, as described in the release(8) manual page.

o About Xenocara
  --------------
Xenocara is the name choosen for OpenBSD's version of X. It's
currently based on X.Org 7.2 and its dependencies. The goal of
Xenocara is to provide a framework to host local modifications and to
automate the build of the modular X.Org components, including 3rd
party packages and some software maintained by OpenBSD developpers.

o Source tree
  -----------

The organisation of the xenocara directory follows the general
organisation used in X.Org:

- app:	     X applications and utilities
- data:	     various data files (keyboard mappings and bitmaps)
- doc:	     documentation
- driver:    input and video drivers
- font:	     fonts
- lib:	     libraries
- proto:     X protocol headers
- util:	     utilities that don't fit anywhere else
- xserver:   the source for the X servers 

In addition Xenocara uses the following directories:

- dist:	    contains the Mesa sources, shared by lib and xserver above
- distrib:  all binary distribution related tools and data
- etc:	    mtree(8) data files
- share:    make(1) configuration for xenocara
