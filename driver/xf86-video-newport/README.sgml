<sect>Supported Hardware
<p>
This is an unaccelerated driver for the SGI newport cards (a.k.a. XL) as found
in the SGI Indy and Indigo2. Both the 8bit and 24bit versions are tested and
working.

<sect>Features
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Support for 8 and 24 bit pixel depths
  <item>Hardware cursor support to reduce flicker
</itemize>

<sect>Notes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>X -configure does not generate a xorg.conf file.
  <item>There's only a 1280x1024 mode.
</itemize>


<sect>Configuration
<p>
The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
initialize the card on the Indy. The only lines you need in the "Device"
section of your xorg.conf file are:
<verb>
       Section "Device"
           Identifier "SGI newport"
           Driver     "newport"
       EndSection
</verb>
Indigo2 users have to use the BusID option as documented below.

However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:
<itemize>
  <item>bitplanes - number of physical bitplanes (8 or 24)
  <item>HWCursor - enable or disable hardware cursor
  <item>BusID - set this to "1" on the Indigo2 XL
</itemize>
