  [1m1.  Supported Hardware[0m

  This is an unaccelerated driver for the SGI newport cards (a.k.a. XL)
  as found in the SGI Indy and Indigo2. Both the 8bit and 24bit versions
  are tested and working.


  [1m2.  Features[0m


  +o  Support for 8 and 24 bit pixel depths

  +o  Hardware cursor support to reduce flicker


  [1m3.  Notes[0m


  +o  X -configure does not generate a xorg.conf file.

  +o  There's only a 1280x1024 mode.



  [1m4.  Configuration[0m

  The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize
  the card on the Indy. The only lines you need in the "Device" section
  of your xorg.conf file are:

         Section "Device"
             Identifier "SGI newport"
             Driver     "newport"
         EndSection


  Indigo2 users have to use the BusID option as documented below.

  However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

  +o  bitplanes - number of physical bitplanes (8 or 24)

  +o  HWCursor - enable or disable hardware cursor

  +o  BusID - set this to "1" on the Indigo2 XL
