  1.  Supported hardware

  The s3virge driver in X11R7.5 supports the S3 ViRGE, ViRGE DX, GX,
  GX2, MX, MX+, and VX chipsets. It also supports Trio3D and Trio3D/2x
  chips. A majority of testing is done on ViRGE DX chips, making them
  the most stable to date. This release has added support for doublescan
  modes on DX.

  This driver is moderately stable, however please use caution with any
  new install. Please report any problems to bugzilla.freedesktop.org,
  using the xorg component.

  o  supports resolutions up to 2048x2048

  o  supports color depths of 8, 15, 16 and 24

  o  full use of video card memory for acceleration caching when visible
     framebuffer leaves extra memory
