	Lazily allocate the dynamic modes used for pixel precise guest
	resizing. They will not appear until they are neeed.

	Unlibcwrap.  Bump server version requirement.  Bump to 10.13.0.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.
	* src/vmware.c
	* src/vmware.h: (VMWAREScreenInit) Set up the additional
	state required by the VMWARE_CTRL extension.
	A src/vmwarectrl.c
	A src/vmwarectrl.h
	A src/vmwarectrlproto.h: Add implementation of the VMWARE_CTRL
	extension.

	This change adds the VMWARE_CTRL extension which allows for
	an X client to request an arbitrary resolution be made
	available in the modeline list. The intent here is not to
	replace XF86VidMode (which, if it would only work, would have
	made VMWARE_CTRL unnecessary) so we are not providing an
	Add/Remove functionality. Rather, a single command "SetRes"
	is provided. This will update one of two special entries in
	the modeline list with the requested resolution (assuming
	it's possible given the fixed framebuffer restriction).
	The client can then use RandR to find and switch to the
	requested resolution. We need two entries because the
	server gets confused when asked to switch to a new
	mode that has the same position in the list as the old
	mode.
	
	vmwarectrl.h and vmwarectrlproto.h follow the standard
	pattern for extension headers and can be dropped into any
	client side project that wishes to call the extension -
	although it is probably of very limited use to non-VMware
	clients.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.
	* src/vmware.c: Implement the DriverFunc so that we
	can adjust the guest 'physical' display size to keep
	DPI constant. Setting the initial display size to
	match the host continues to be an exercise for the user.
