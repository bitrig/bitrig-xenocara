openchrome 0.2.902 (08/04/2008)
-------------------------------
* Enhancements and bug fixes:
- libpciaccess support.
- Fix Xv on LCD for VM800/CN700/P4M800pro.
- Fix P4M900 fifo setting.
- Various code clean up.

* New boards:
- ASRock P4VM900-SATA2, Asustek M2V-MX SE, Asustek P5VD2-VM SE,
  Biostar P4M800 Pro-M7, Clevo M54xSR, Clevo M660SR, Medion Notebook MD96483,
  Mitac 8515, Mitac 8624, MSI Fuzzy CX700/CX700D, Packard Bell EasyNote XS
  (aka Everex Cloudbook CE1200V), VIA Epia SN.

* Notes:
- The "HWCursor" option has been removed. Hardware-accelerated cursor is on by
  default, so this option was useless. Use the "SWCursor" option if you want to
  disable HW cursor.
- AGPDMA has been disabled for K8M800 and VM800/CN700/P4M800pro in this release
  because it causes screen repaint and lockup issues. The problem has been
  tracked down to a bug in kernel drm. All kernel >= 2.6.22 are affected. This
  bug will be fixed in the upcoming 2.6.25-rc7. It is also fixed in current
  drm git tree. If you're using one of the affected kernels, you'll have to
  either keep AGPDMA disabled  or build the modules from the fixed drm git
  tree. This option brings extra performance for some operations. To use it,
  add 'Option "EnableAGPDMA"' in the Device section of the xorg configuration.
