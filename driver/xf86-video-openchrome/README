SUPPORTED FEATURES :
--------------------

- VBE modesetting for everything not natively supported.
- TV-out support.
- EXA acceleration.
- Hardware MPEG2 acceleration.


KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS :
------------------------
* Laptop panel
- Laptop displays for anything other than CLE266 and KM400/P4M800 are only
  supported thru VBE calls.
- Virtual terminal is broken on some laptop displays. Use a vesa framebuffer to
  work around that (append vga=791 to your kernel command line, for example).

* XvMC
- The hardware MPEG4 acceleration that is present on some chipsets is not
  implemented.
- No XvMC support for CX700 and newer (new, unsupported engine).
- No XvMC support for K8M890, P4M890 and P4M900/VN896 (need to get dri working
  for them first).

* TV output
- TV modes are hardcoded and must be choosen inside a list depending on the TV
  encoder.
- Outputs are dependent on each other and will use the least common
  denominator. If you're using both VGA/LCD output and TV output, the VGA/LCD
  output will be limited by the TV encoder (720x576@50Hz for example).
  In other words, there is no dual screen support.

* Misc.
- Add-on TMDS encoders are not supported, except thru VBE.
- CX700, VX800 and VX855 integrated TMDS is supported.

* Chrome9
- Chrome9 chipsets' family (P4M900, K8M890, VX800, VX855, VX900) currently
  doesn't support neither AGP DMA nor 3D acceleration.
