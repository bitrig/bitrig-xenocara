  1.  Supported Hardware


  o  Intel 740 based cards.



  2.  Features


  o  Full support for 8, 15, 16, and 24 bit pixel depths.

  o  Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.

  o  Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and 24
     bit pixel depths.

  o  Support for high resolution video modes up to 1600x1200.

  o  Support for doublescan video modes (e.g., 320x200 and 320x240).

  o  Support for gamma correction at all pixel depths.

  o  Fully programmable clock supported.

  o  Robust text mode restore for VT switching.



  3.  Technical Notes

  5.  Configuration

  The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize
  the card. The only lines you need in the "Device" section of your
  xorg.conf file are:

         Section "Device"
             Identifier "Intel i740"
             Driver     "i740"
         EndSection



  However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

  o  VideoRam - in kilobytes

  o  DacSpeed - in MHz

  o  MemBase - physical address of the linear framebuffer

  o  IOBase - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers



  6.  Driver Options


  o  "NoAccel" - Turn off hardware acceleration

  o  "SWCursor" - Request a software cursor (hardware is default)

  o  "SDRAM" - Force the use of SDRAM timings

  o  "SGRAM" - Force the use of SGRAM timings

  o  "SlowRam" - Force the use of slower ram timings

  o  "Dac6Bit" - Force the use of a 6 Bit Dac (8 Bit is the default)

  o  "UsePIO - Force the use of programmed IO (Memory mapped is the
     default)

  Note: the i740 X server should automatically detect whether your card
  has SGRAM or SDRAM. Use the "sgram" and "sdram" options if it is
  incorrectly detected.



  7.  Known Limitations


  o  Certain drawing operations are very slow when using 24 bit pixel
     depth mode.
