TODO

Rotation
FIFO level handling code maybe needed for heavy 2D
Hardware Gamma correction
Proper DPMS for Voodoo2
DRI

DRI thoughts:
Figure out out to use YAB textures for Xv
X runs on the front buffer
DRI draws on the backbuffer
2D engine can do the screen to screen blits
Backbuffer allocation is problematic as memory is short. One way
  might be to allocate those rectangles that are visible only ?
For voodoo1 DRI is somewhat harder but Voodoo2like with software fallback 
  except fullscreen would work 8)


Random Ramblings:
The right way to write a Voodoo1 X server is to use shadow buffers for
each visible window area and dump them into texture buffers then composite
the textures using the 3D engine.  XFree86 alas doesn't think that way.
Maybe Keith's server can be persuaded to do so some day. Maybe I should
just buy a better video card.
