Release 2.7.1 (2009-05-12)
--------------------------
This is a maintenance release on the 2.7 branch. Compared to 2.7.0 it
consists only of a few carefully hand-picked fixes for bugs,
(including GPU crashers). We encourage all users of 2.7.0 to upgrade
to 2.7.1.

Bug fixes since 2.7.0:

    * KMS: Hook up output properties for RANDR, (this allows output
      properties to be controlled in the KMS case just as in the UMS
      case). [Zhenyu Wang <zhenyu.z.wang@intel.com>]

    * Fix multiplication error when computing required batch space.
      This could fix any number of cases where the driver did
      inexplicable things (due to having computed the wrong
      size). [Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>]

    * Hold reference to video binding table until all rects are
      painted. This prevent general chaos in the buffer
      manager. [Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>]

    * Split i915 textured video commands to fit into batch
      buffers. Video and 3D setup commands share the same batch
      buffer, so without this fix, various problems could occur when
      video and 3D clients were both heavily active at the same
      time. [Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>]

    * Fix crash with XV with large virtual display (> 2049). [Albert
      Damen <albrt@gmx.net>]

    * Provide missing value to 3D_STATE_VERTEX_BUFFERS command. We
      don't know that this was causing any problem, but the change
      does bring the driver into conformance with what the
      specification says the hardware requires here. [Keith Packard
      <keithp@keithp.com>]

Release 2.7.0 (2009-04-15)
--------------------------
Compared to the 2.6 series, 2.7.0 has a large number of bug fixes, but
also a few significant features, such as:

        SDVO-TV support, available on ADD2 card (bug#9992) and
        D945GCLF2 board (bug#17776).

        Basic SDVO-LVDS support

        XV video display without tearing
	[Though this isn't working for all users yet, see
	https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21076 ]

	Various fixes for UXA, DRI2, and Kernel modesetting.

We encourage users to use kernel modesetting and UXA acceleration with
this release, which should give the best performance and
robustness. When KMS is available, UXA is the default acceleration
used by the driver, (EXA is the default otherwise).

Known issue:

	Some Linux kernel versions (such as 2.6.29) are known to have
	broken PAT code that causes recent versions of this driver to
	fail, (which can manifest as the X server simply not
	starting). This can be verified by adding the "nopat" option
	to the kernel command-line and seeing the failure go away. We
	hope that newer kernels in the 2.6.29.x as well as 2.6.30 and
	above will have working PAT code.
