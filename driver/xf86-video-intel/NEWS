Release 2.9.1 (2009-10-26)
==========================
We are pleased to announce a maintenance release (2.9.1) of the
xf86-video-intel driver. This release comes one month after 2.9.0 and
consists only of a few, hand-picked bug fixes since that release.

Complete list of fixes in 2.9.1 compared to 2.9.0
-------------------------------------------------
 * Fix corruption and artifacts due to wrong colors in the colormap
   with X server 1.7

 * Fix incorrect rendering, such as missing scrollbar arrows in some
   themes (http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24459)

 * Fix black screen when X server is reset
   (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24383)

 * Fix regressions detecting DVI monitors

Release 2.9.0 (2009-09-28)
==========================
We are pleased to announce the 2.9.0 release of the xf86-video-intel
driver. (If you have been following along at home, this release is
identical to the 2.8.99.902 release candidate other than the version
number).

New features in 2.9 compared to 2.8
-----------------------------------
* Support for the B43 chipset.

Major fixes in 2.9.0 compared to 2.8.0
--------------------------------------
* Multiple fixes to make the driver stable for 8xx chipsets, (855GM,
  865G, etc.). The 2.8 driver series was extremely unstable with many
  of these chipsets.

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22904 (and many duplicates)
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22947

* Add support for BACKLIGHT property when using kernel modesetting
  (KMS). This allows backlight adjustment with programs such as
  "xbacklight -set <percentage>" or "xrandr --set BACKLIGHT <value>".

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20963

* Fix so that "xrandr --scale" works when using KMS.

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22893

* Fix segfaults of X server when logging out.

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20516

* Avoid falling back to software for 1-bit alpha-only masks.

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23184

* Fix pixel sampling position for 8xx chipsets, (fixes some cairo-test
  suite failures).

Snapshot 2.8.99.901 (2009-09-09)
================================
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.9.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from testing
of this snapshot to improve the 2.9.0 release.

See the commit log for changes in this release, and developers, please
provide me summaries for any major features in this release that you
think should appear in NEWS and in the 2.9.0 release notes.

Note: We are still investigating failures with 865G chipsets, (these
failures existed in the 2.8 series as well). We are hoping to fix
these failures before the 2.9.0 release.

Release 2.8.0 (2009-07-20)
==========================
We are pleased to present this major release of the xf86-video-intel
driver. This release is very similar to the 2.7.99.902 release
candidate but includes a couple of additional bug fixes, (for bugs
#22760 and @22483).

Compared to the 2.7 releases this driver contains several new features
and many bug fixes. The driver now depends on X server 1.6 or later,
and eliminates several obsolete code paths, (XAA and EXA removed in
favor of UXA, DRI1 support eliminated). The driver certainly will work
best with an i915 module from a recent kernel (2.6.31) and with
kernel-modesetting (KMS, specified by loading i915 with the option
"modeset=1").

New features in 2.8.0 compared to 2.7
-------------------------------------
* Remove XAA/EXA/DRI1 and NoAccel, and only support UXA/DRI2 now
  (requiring xserver 1.6).

* VLD support added into XvMC for Mpeg2, which decreases CPU usage
  when playing video.

Major fixes in 2.8.0 compared to 2.7
------------------------------------
* Fix broken front-buffer rendering
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19174

* Fix disabling of XvMC disabled
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20790

* Fix broken VT switch on some machines
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19578

* Improve performance of trapezoid rendering for UXA
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21376

* Vblank sync'd GL buffer swap (fixing video tearing under composite)
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20664

* Fix G41 DRM support
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21095

* Fix crash on some 8xx
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18974

Various fixes for GPU hangs, and more...

Snapshot 2.7.99.902 (2009-07-13)
--------------------------------
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.8.0 release. Most major and critical bugs should be fixed, but some
minor bugs may still be present. We will appreciate any feedback we
can get from testing of this snapshot to improve the 2.8.0 release.

Snapshot 2.7.99.901 (2009-06-10)
--------------------------------
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.8.0 release. Most critical bugs should be fixed, but some major
bugs may still be present. We will appreciate any feedback we can
get from testing of this snapshot to improve the 2.8.0 release.

Some of the major fixes in this snapshot include:

	* Several fixes for intermittent GPU hangs/crashes, (some of
	  which already appeared in the 2.7.1 release)

	* Fix to avoid X crash when viewing large images in browser

	* Fix X server failure when running old (non-GEM) kernel

	* Fixes for SDVO LVDS mode detection

	* Fix major performance regression of trapezoid rendering
          compared to XAA/EXA

	* New support for tear-free video when using KMS

	* New support for tear-free DRI2 CopyRegion

Snapshot 2.7.99.1 (2009-04-28)
------------------------------
This is a development snapshot very early in the process toward
developing 2.8. There have been some big changes to the code, and
we're anxious to get feedback on these changes as early as possible.

Here is a summary of the biggest changes:

  * Driver now depends on X server 1.6 or later

  * Eliminate XAA and EXA support (in favor of UXA)

  * Eliminate DRI1 support

  * Fixes for running without DRI at all

These code removals represent a deletion of a substantial amount of
code, (and hopefully piles of bugs), as well as reduce the maintenance
effort going forward as the number of combinatorial configurations for
the driver are greatly reduced. This means that users are much more
likely to be running code that has actually been tested, and it will
be much easy for developers to replicate bugs that users experience.

One of the things that would be most useful in testing this release is
to revisit any outstanding bugs that you have previously reported. If
the buggy behavior is gone, (or the bug is no longer relevant---such
as a bug that's specific to XAA only), please feel free to indicate so
in bugzilla or even just close the bug.

If you confirm that the bug is still present, please indicate so in
the bug report. (I was going to ask that you select a 1.7.99 version,
but it looks like bugzilla only has versions for products not
compoenents, while we use a "xorg" product and a "driver/intel"
component.) We definitely want to make any such confirmed bugs a
priority, so it would be nice to have a consistent mechanism to search
for these bugs. Suggestions are welcome on the best approach.

Thanks in advance for any testing or feedback on this snapshot.

Release 2.7.0 (2009-04-15)
--------------------------
Compared to the 2.6 series, 2.7.0 has a large number of bug fixes, but
also a few significant features, such as:

        SDVO-TV support, available on ADD2 card (bug#9992) and
        D945GCLF2 board (bug#17776).

        Basic SDVO-LVDS support

        XV video display without tearing
	[Though this isn't working for all users yet, see
	https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21076 ]

	Various fixes for UXA, DRI2, and Kernel modesetting.

We encourage users to use kernel modesetting and UXA acceleration with
this release, which should give the best performance and
robustness. When KMS is available, UXA is the default acceleration
used by the driver, (EXA is the default otherwise).

Known issue:

	Some Linux kernel versions (such as 2.6.29) are known to have
	broken PAT code that causes recent versions of this driver to
	fail, (which can manifest as the X server simply not
	starting). This can be verified by adding the "nopat" option
	to the kernel command-line and seeing the failure go away. We
	hope that newer kernels in the 2.6.29.x as well as 2.6.30 and
	above will have working PAT code.

Some of the most notable bugs fixed in 2.7.0 include:
