/**
 * @file intel_memory.c
 *
 * This is the video memory allocator.  Our memory allocation is different from
 * other graphics chips, where you have a fixed amount of graphics memory
 * available that you want to put to the best use.  Instead, we have almost no
 * memory pre-allocated, and we have to choose an appropriate amount of sytem
 * memory to use.
 *
 * The allocations we might do:
 *
 * - Ring buffer
 * - HW cursor block (either one block or four)
 * - Overlay registers
 * - Front buffer (screen 1)
 * - Front buffer (screen 2, only in zaphod mode)
 * - Back/depth buffer (3D only)
 * - Compatibility texture pool (optional, more is always better)
 * - New texture pool (optional, more is always better.  aperture allocation
 *     only)
 *
 * The user may request a specific amount of memory to be used
 * (intel->pEnt->videoRam != 0), in which case allocations have to fit within
 * that much aperture.  If not, the individual allocations will be
 * automatically sized, and will be fit within the maximum aperture size.
 * Only the actual memory used (not alignment padding) will get actual AGP
 * memory allocated.
 *
 * Given that the allocations listed are generally a page or more than a page,
 * our allocator will only return page-aligned offsets, simplifying the memory
 * binding process.  For smaller allocations, the acceleration architecture's
 * linear allocator is preferred.
