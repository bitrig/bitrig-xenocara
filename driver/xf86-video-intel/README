  11..  IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn

  This document provides a brief summary of the Intel graphics support
  provided by the xf86-video-intel driver.  More information can also be
  found in the i810(4) manual page.

  +o  Full support for 8, 15, 16, and 24 bit pixel depths.

  +o  Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and 24
     bit pixel depths.

  +o  Hardware accelerated 3D drawing using OpenGL and the DRI.

  +o  Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.

  +o  Textured video XV implementation on i915 through i965.

  +o  Hardware overlay XV implementation up through i945.

  +o  Screen resize and rotation on chipsets up through i945.

  +o  Screen resize on i965.



  44..  TTeecchhnniiccaall NNootteess


  +o  Interlace modes cannot be supported.

  +o  This driver  requires kernel support for AGP, which is included in
     Linux kernels 2.3.42 and higher, and FreeBSD 4.1 and higher.



  55..  CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn

  The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize
  the card.  The only lines you should need in the "Device" section of
  your xorg.conf file are:

         Section "Device"
             Identifier "Intel i810"
             Driver     "i810"
         EndSection



  In order to use most resolutions, it is necessary to install the
  "agpgart.o" module.  You will probably have to compile the module
  yourself (see the notes in the module).

  Please refer to the i810(4) manual page for information on
  configuration options.

  +o  Many systems with Intel graphics have issues with setting video
     modes at larger than some small maximum resolution.  This is not
     fixed in the current release, but is being actively worked on in
     the modesetting branch.

  +o  Bug #5795: Some systems have issues with VT switching.  This should
     be fixed with the modesetting brach integration.

  +o  Bug #5817: Hotkey switching from LVDS to CRT breaks CRT output.
     This is a known issue, but will not be fixed in the current
     release.

  +o  Bug #6635: Video is output from an incorrect offset in the
     framebuffer.  This is expected to be fixed with the modesetting
     branch integration.

  +o  GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc is not supported.  We can't support
     the extension due to patent restrictions on compression, but may be
     able to support an option for partial extension support in the
     future.  For now, this prevents Quake4 and some other games from
     running.

  +o  Some X Test Suite cases sometimes fail due to a timeout. These
     cases include: Xt8/XtResizeWindow, Xt8/XtQueryGeometry,
     Xt9/XtAppAddInput, Xt9/XtRemoveInput, Xt9/XtAppAddTimeOut,
     Xt9/XtRemoveTimeOut, Xt9/XtAddGrab, Xt9/XtRemoveGrab.

  +o  Some X Test Suite cases fail in 64-bit mode: Xlib9/XDrawArc,
     XDrawImageString, XDrawLine, XDrawRectangle, XDrawSegments,
     XFillArc, XFillPolygon, XFillRectangle, XPutImage,
     Xt11/XtVaGetSubresources, XtSetSubvalues, and XtVaSetSubvalues.

  +o  Some GLEAN test cases fail if DRI is enabled: pointAtten,
     readPixSanity, texCombine, texCube, texEnv, texgen,
     coloredTexPerf2, and coloredLitPerf2.
