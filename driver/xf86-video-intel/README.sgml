<title>Information for Intel graphics driver users

<sect>Introduction
<p>
This document provides a brief summary of the Intel graphics support provided
by the xf86-video-intel driver.  More information can also be found in the
<htmlurl name="i810(4)" url="i810.4.html"> manual page.

<sect>Supported Hardware
<p>
<itemize>
	<item>i810,
  	<item>i810-dc100,
	<item>i810e
	<item>i815
	<item>i830
	<item>i845
	<item>i852
	<item>i855
	<item>i915
	<item>i945
	<item>i965
</itemize>


<sect>Features
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Full support for 8, 15, 16, and 24 bit pixel depths.
  <item>Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and
        24 bit pixel depths.
  <item>Hardware accelerated 3D drawing using OpenGL and the DRI.
  <item>Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.
  <item>Textured video XV implementation on i915 through i965.
  <item>Hardware overlay XV implementation up through i945.
  <item>Screen resize and rotation on chipsets up through i945.
  <item>Screen resize on i965.
</itemize>


<sect>Technical Notes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Interlace modes cannot be supported.
  <item>This driver  requires kernel support for AGP, which is
	included in Linux kernels 2.3.42 and higher, and FreeBSD 4.1
	and higher.
</itemize>


<sect>Configuration
<p>
The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
initialize the card.  The only lines you should need in the "Device"
section of your xorg.conf file are:
<verb>
       Section "Device"
           Identifier "Intel i810"
           Driver     "i810"
       EndSection
</verb>

In order to use most resolutions, it is necessary to install the
"agpgart.o" module.  You will probably have to compile the module yourself
(see the notes in the module).

<sect>Driver Options
<p>
Please refer to the <htmlurl name="i810(4)" url="i810.4.html"> manual page
for information on configuration options.


<sect>Known Limitations
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Many systems with Intel graphics have issues with setting video modes
at larger than some small maximum resolution.  This is not fixed in the current
release, but is being actively worked on in the modesetting branch.
  <item>Bug #5795: Some systems have issues with VT switching.  This should
be fixed with the modesetting brach integration.
  <item>Bug #5817: Hotkey switching from LVDS to CRT breaks CRT output.  This
is a known issue, but will not be fixed in the current release.
  <item>Bug #6635: Video is output from an incorrect offset in the framebuffer.
This is expected to be fixed with the modesetting branch integration.
  <item>GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc is not supported.  We can't support the
extension due to patent restrictions on compression, but may be able to support
an option for partial extension support in the future.  For now, this prevents
Quake4 and some other games from running.
  <item>Some X Test Suite cases sometimes fail due to a timeout. These cases
include: Xt8/XtResizeWindow, Xt8/XtQueryGeometry, Xt9/XtAppAddInput,
Xt9/XtRemoveInput, Xt9/XtAppAddTimeOut, Xt9/XtRemoveTimeOut, Xt9/XtAddGrab,
Xt9/XtRemoveGrab.
  <item>Some X Test Suite cases fail in 64-bit mode: Xlib9/XDrawArc,
XDrawImageString, XDrawLine, XDrawRectangle, XDrawSegments, XFillArc,
XFillPolygon, XFillRectangle, XPutImage, Xt11/XtVaGetSubresources,
XtSetSubvalues, and XtVaSetSubvalues.
  <item>Some GLEAN test cases fail if DRI is enabled: pointAtten,
readPixSanity, texCombine, texCube, texEnv, texgen, coloredTexPerf2, and
coloredLitPerf2.
</itemize>
