<sect>Introduction
<p>
This document provides a brief summary of the i810/i815 support provided
by the i810 driver.  Support for later chipsets is not covered here.
More up to date information about the i810 driver can be found in the
<htmlurl name="i810(4)" url="i810.4.html"> manual page.

<sect>Supported Hardware
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Intel 810 motherboards:
	<itemize>
	  <item>i810,
	  <item>i810-dc100,
	  <item>i810e
	  <item>i815
	</itemize>
</itemize>


<sect>Features
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Full support for 8, 15, 16, and 24 bit pixel depths.
  <item>Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.
  <item>Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and
        24 bit pixel depths.
  <item>Support for high resolution video modes up to 1600x1200.
  <item>Fully programmable clock supported.
  <item>Robust text mode restore for VT switching.
</itemize>


<sect>Technical Notes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Hardware acceleration is not possible when using the framebuffer
	in 32 bit per pixel format, and this mode is not supported by
	this driver.
  <item>Interlace modes cannot be supported.
  <item>This driver currently only works for Linux/ix86 and recent versions
	of FreeBSD.  It requires the agpgart kernel support, which is
	included in Linux kernels 2.3.42 and higher, and FreeBSD 4.1
	and higher.
</itemize>


<sect>Reported Working Video Cards
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Intel evaluation hardware - i810, i810-dc100, i810e and i815.
  <item>Tyan Tomcat Motherboard.
  <item>HappyPC set-top box.
</itemize>


<sect>Configuration
<p>
The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
section of your xorg.conf file are:
<verb>
       Section "Device"
           Identifier "Intel i810"
           Driver     "i810"
       EndSection
</verb>
or let <tt>xorgconfig</tt> do this for you.

However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:
<itemize>
  <item>DacSpeed - in MHz
  <item>MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
  <item>IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers
</itemize>

In order to use most resolutions, it is necessary to install the
'agpgart.o' module.  You will probably have to compile the module yourself
(see the notes in the module).

Note: the i810 driver detects whether your motherboard has display cache
video memory.  This memory is has reduced bandwidth compared to normal
system memory, and isn't used by the server.  The main function of this
memory is for ancillary buffers (eg. z buffer) in a forthcoming 3d
capable server.


<sect>Driver Options
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>"NoAccel"  - Turn off hardware acceleration
  <item>"SWCursor" - Request a software cursor (hardware is default)
  <item>"Dac6Bit"  - Force the use of a 6 Bit Dac (8 Bit is the default)
</itemize>

<sect>Known Limitations
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>No 3D support in this release.
  <item>Running two X servers on different VTs is not supported at this time.
</itemize>
