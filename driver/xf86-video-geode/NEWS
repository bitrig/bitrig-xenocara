Geode 2.11.16 (2014-07-17)
==========================
No user-visible change:

 * This release restores compatibility with xserver-1.15 and newer
   by adding a missing xf86Modes.h include to src/geode_dcon.c

Geode 2.11.15 (2013-10-09)
==========================
No user-visible change:

 * This release restores compatibility with xserver-1.14 by removing
   mibstore.h includes and miInitializeBackingStore() functions.
   Since Nov.2010 (commit c4c4676) the only purpose of mibstore.h
   was to define an empty function for backward compatibility.

 * Build helpers migrate to contemporary [build-aux] and [m4].

Geode 2.11.14 (2012-11-25)
==========================
Better compatibility with xserver-1.13, cairo-1.12 and gtk3:

 * Fix building on Xservers without XAA (Maarten Lankhorst)
   xserver-1.13 dropped XAA acceleration method, as it does not accel
   anything important used on modern desktops.
   The geode driver now supports configuring whether to include XAA
   support - by default it is automatically disabled with newest
   xservers that do not support it, but can be explicitly disabled for
   older xservers as well if desired (particularly for LX deployments).
   XAA support remains in place for the time being for older xservers,
   as the EXA support for GX2 GPUs is of unknown quality and speed.

 * Fix building with new xserver-1.13 API (Maarten Lankhorst)
   xserver-1.13 changed API, including moving various global symbols
   behind function calls, to better support multiple switchable graphics
   cards and hotplugged (USB) graphics cards. Work done to support both
   pre-1.13 and 1.13+ APIs in other drivers is reused to bring the same
   support to the Geode driver.

 * Implement solid source pictures acceleration (Mart Raudsepp)
   cairo-1.12 uses these extensively for text rendering, instead of 1x1
   repeating images that cairo-1.10 used and we already accelerate.
   Without acceleration, in addition to being slow, we'd hit a fallback
   handling bug in EXA with xserver older than 1.13.1, which results in
   very visible text corruption in many instances.

 * Handle negative srcX and srcY parameters better in EXA Composite
   operations, used via the RENDER extension (Mart Raudsepp)
   Handling of source picture coordinates outside actual source pixmap
   area is still subpar and ignoring spec in some corner cases, but
   a more specific case is improved to provide correct results in more
   situations. In particular this fixes GtkTrayIcon drawing via cairo as
   used by gtk3, specifically as seen in GNOME3 fallback desktop.
   Previously no icon was drawn at all if the icon needed centering to the
   drawing area, which in the end is achieved via a negative srcX/srcY.

 * Fix builds for exotic and/or non-target platforms (Dave Airlie)

 * Clarify the copyright of older AMD commits (Martin-Ã‰ric Racine)

VALIDATION PLATFORMS
 * Debian (X server 1.7.7) on Artec DBE61 and Hercules EC-800.
 * Debian (X server 1.12.14) on FIC ION603A.
 * Fedora (X server 1.13) on OLPC XO-1.

Geode 2.11.13 (2011-12-26)
==========================
This release mainly features a complete overhaul of the building scripts plus
a cleanup of deprecated macros. The key benefit is that this Geode driver can
finally build on FreeBSD and on other platforms not offering V4L2 support and
that it can also build on a 64-bit host using its 32-bit personality.

Support for the Video Input Port (VIP) feature of the Geode LX found in 'ztv'
is now documented and the source code saw the removal of deprecated Linux 2.4
backward compatibility code. Compiling is skipped on platforms without V4L2.

Configuration for laptops featuring WXGA resolutions is finally documented.

Setting the GEODE_TRACE_FALL macro now enables composite operation tracing on
this driver. This can be used to profile the performance during development.

Fixes to keep this driver compilable on recent X servers are also included.

VALIDATION PLATFORMS
* Debian (X server 1.7.7) on Artec DBE61 and Hercules EC-800.
* Ubuntu (X server 1.10.4) on FIC ION603A.

Geode 2.11.12 (2011-02-13)
==========================
This release drops the "linux/videodev.h" include in z4l.c because
V4L1 support was dropped as of Linux kernel 2.6.38, and it fixes 
packed overlay offscreen allocations.

Geode 2.11.11 (2010-12-27)
==========================
This release restores code compatibility down to X server 1.4, it fixes
compilation under 1.9.99 and newer, and it improves handling of gamma
correction in video vs graphics

Geode 2.11.10 (2010-11-09)
==========================
This release migrates deprecated xalloc/xrealloc/xfree/xcalloc calls
to malloc/realloc/free/calloc, fixes several DCON-specific issues, 
improves mode validation and adds support for one WXGA resolution.

Geode 2.11.9 (2010-08-23)
=========================
We are pleased to announce this maintenance release of xf86-video-geode.
It features a plethora of bug fixes, a few documentation updates and one
performance enhancement.

This release also marks the return of AMD to the development team. 

Noticeable changes compared to 2.11.8
-------------------------------------
 * Fixes all known rendering bugs, most notably those pertaining to the
   GNOME and KDE desktop environments, to video player applications and
   to the Chrome and Firefox browsers.

 * Dramatically improves the performance:
                      Before         After
    -aa10text         4660/sec       53300/sec
    -aa24text         2740/sec       16200/sec

 * Validates resolutions rather than resorts to virtual screen sizes.
   Adds a new screen resolution at 106.50MHz to those we know about.

 * Clarifies the copyrights of each file and updates COPYING to match.
