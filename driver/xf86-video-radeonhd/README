radeonhd - the X.org X11 driver for AMD GPG r5xx/r6xx chipsets
==============================================================

radeonhd is the X.org X11 driver for AMD GPG (ATI) r5xx/r6xx chipsets.
Main development is driven by Novell at the time of writing, in close
relationship to AMD which provides free documentation for the chipsets.

More detailed notes about
  * supported chipsets (replicated below)
  * radeonhd driver options
  * troubleshooting
are available in the included radeonhd(4) man page.

Further information about
  * known radeonhd bugs & limitations
  * frequently asked questions (FAQ)
  * how to configure RandR
  * configuration examples
is available on the wiki at http://wiki.x.org/wiki/radeonhd
