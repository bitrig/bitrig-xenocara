    LUT: reduce number of writes to DC_LUT_RW_INDEX
    
    The value of DC_LUT_RW_INDEX is increased everytime DC_LUT_30_COLOR is
    accessed.  It is pointless to set this explicitly for each row of the
    input colour table.

    As noted by mhopf, if VGT_MAX/MIN_INDX, etc. regs change, you need to re-emit
    CB blocks to avoid a hang. So, just set the VGT_MAX_INDX to a reasonably large value
    in the default state and don't touch them when drawing. When we run out of VB space,
    just draw the current buffer, grab a new one, and continue.

    R6xx/R7xx Xv: Planar - Properly scale Y'CbCr values before converting to RGB
    
    According to MPEG-2 spec, Y' and Cb/Cr values are scaled to [16, 235]
    and [16, 240], respectively, when packed into bytes. Properly take care
    of the reverse scaling before translating to RGB.
    
    Conversion matrix has been simplified to remove 3rd column, as the fitting
    to [-0.5, 0.5] can be done with scaling.
    
    Redundant MOV instructions were also removed, and now only 3 GPRs are
    required.

    r6xx/r7xx EXA: Optimize overlapping copy
    
    When source and destination blocks are only offset horizontally, it
    appears to be unnecessary to perform careful, segment-by-segment copy.
    The code path that does this is taken out completely.
    
    For the case where offset is only vertical, copying is now done by
    height of the non-overlapping area each time, instead of always
    line-by-line.

    R6xx/R7xx: fix alignment
    
    pitch needs to be a multiple of 128 rather than 64 since
    UV is pitch/2

    R6xx/R7xx: Get Xv working (at least for me)
    
    - updated conversion matrix and swizzle fixes from Aidan Thornton
    (makomk on IRC)
    - set comp swap to 1 in the CB.  shader to CB component ordering seems
    to be ABGR rather than ARGB which would explain some of the other issues with EXA.
    setting comp swap to 1 changes the ordering from ABGR to ARGB

    R6xx/R7xx: Add initial EXA/Xv support
    
    First pass at r6xx/r7xx EXA and Xv support.  This release
    is mostly targeted at developers as the code is not really
    ready for regular users.
    
    Current status:
    - lack of direction blitter makes overlapping copy blits difficult.
    current code breaks down overlapping blits into line by line
    blits of non-overlapping regions.  running xcompmgr -a is highly
    recommended.
    - a8 solids have issues
    - planar Xv shader implemented, but not working properly yet
    - missing Xv shader support for packed formats.  should be easy to
    adapt the planar Xv shader once that is working
    - composite mask support is currently broken.  I suspect the interpolater
    setup.
    - depth 16 is untested

    Add 'force-shadowfb' AccelMethod. For testing purposes only.
    
    force-shadowfb will force shadowfb even if DRI is enabled. The driver
    currently will spill out Damage events for DRI updates, which will overdraw
    the rendered image immediately.
    This is mostly useful for development of r600_demo, which programs the chip
    directly, and will thus not create Damage events.

    MC/Idle: ASSERT() the right setup order, don't change an unidled MC.
    
    AllIdle() needs to be called before MCSetup() to make sure the
    MC is idle. We can only idle the MC when the VGA subsystem is
    disabled which happens in VGADisable() which therefore needs
    to be called first.
    If we are not idle in MCSetup() we fail without setting up the MC.
    If MCSetup() fails we bail. If the MC is not idle during restore
    we don't restore the MC.

    RandR: Improve heuristics to determine of an output is connected.
    
    On a multi output connector DDC and HPD are per connector - not per
    output.
    Thus they don't allow to destinguish which of the outputs is connected.
    If the output provides a sense function it can be used to determine the
    connection state. If it doesn't - but the other output(s) on the same
    connector do, they can be probed applying the inverse logic: if another
    output is connected, this one most likely isn't.
    
    Code for this existed already for outputs which provide HPD. We now
    also use it for outputs which don't.

    BugFix for RandR cursor interface
    
    This commit fixes a small bug introduced with the new RandR cursor
    interface. Since RHDxf86InitCursor isn't called with RandR cursors

    Rotation: NULL callbacks to rotation functions if no HW acceleration is enabled.
    
    This avoids rotation to show up in RandR when it's not supported.
    Currently we don't support rotation when no accelration is available
    as we'd have to needlessly copy between two buffers in local memory
    in software.

    Rotation: Don't allow to set a PANNING_AREA when rotated.
    
    Supporting panning while rotated would require some changes in the
    RandR code: presently the size of the scanout buffer is clamped to
    H/VDisplay, this determines the area that's copied.

    DCE3.0: Properly map DCE3.0 DIG encoders.
    
    The hard coded mapping between encoders and transmitters caused problems
    especially on some mobile devices which were using both LVTMA and UNIPHY.
    Furthermore DCE3.0 (and even more DCE3.2) provides a larger number of
    transmitters than there are encoders available. If a card makes more
    transmitters available than the ASIC provides encoders not all transmitters
    can be used simulatniously.
    This fix extends the output subsystem API by an opional output allocation
    sceme. If a certain output subsystem needs to allocate limited internal
    resources before being able to use an output it can do so when this newly
    implemented allocation function is called.

    FreeBSD sed does not understand \t or \n in the substitute
    string.
    
    This commit fixes the updating of README as it only uses \t
    which can easily be replaced by a tab character.
    
    The man/radeonhd.man update uses \n which is more difficult
    to handle and thus will be handled in a later commit.

    we save quite a bit of CPU usage in the DRM CP case.

    DDC: Assume all DDC lines on R5xx and later are HW capable.
    
    Some connector tables are broken such that they don't flag the type of
    I2C line correctly. Still they will match a GPIO I2C LUT entry. Since
    we now use the table index as DDC line ID we are able to deal with this
    situation when we assume that DDC lines are HW capable. So far we
    haven't come across any R5xx system which uses non-HW capable GPIO
    lines for DDC.

    RandR: Improve handling physical outputs which map to multiple RandR outputs.
    
    Outputs like DACs can drive multiple RandR outputs (one at a time).
    RandR doesn't seem to have a notion of this. Thus when probing for
    one RandR outputs we need to probe all other possible RandR outputs
    which map to this same physical output and make a decision which one
    we report to RandR as connected.
    For now and for the case of the DACs we just report TVout as disconnected
    this needs to be change once TV output is fixed.

    pairs. RS690 and and DCE3.0 chipsets can use lines from different
    pairs.
    This fixes the handling of GPIO lines properly for RS690. So far
    it has only worked on RS690 purely by accident.

    No need to reset the 3D scissors when using the CP in the xserver
    
    They should only affect the 3D pipe and init3d() takes care of this case.

    AtomBIOS: Check all lists if a register has already been saved.
    
    This is the proper fix to the problem 'hot-fixed' in
             f5b0d7c452fd49e8581485b5a8efc7a0ad37ba9f.
    It we record all save lists (ie. lists from all subsystems) that have been
    used and check them all if a register has already been saved.
    This saves us from saving a register twice (the second time with an already
    modified value) in which case restore becomes very order dependent.

    AtomBIOS: Temporary fix for CRTC Restore with AtomBIOS.
    
    EnableCRTCMemReq controls memory access per CRTC. It however
    accesses registers in the DC blocks which are shared between
    the CRTCs.
    Thus if we don't want to save these registers separately
    we need to restore CRTCs in the opposite order we have saved
    them in.
    The real fix would be to save/restore the affected registers
    separately.

    These functions used to save/restore CRTC registers directly.
    Since the save/restore functions of the different CRTC subsystems

    more but can be moved up to a generic level that is called

    Add initial support for RV770
    
    Still no DDC, but the DC i2c regs are the same as the other DCE 3.0
    (RV620, etc.) radeon cards so it shouldn't be too bad.

    RandR/AtomBIOS: Fill out Crtc member of rhdOutput struct early.
    
    AtomBIOS SetPixelClock needs information about the output. This
    is obtained by scanning the list of outputs for the Crtc assigned
    to the pixel clock. Thus the Crtc member of the output struct needs
    to be filled out before.

    AtomBIOS: Use save function to set up AtomBIOS config to pre-startup state of HW.

commit 5b47bec87909060152d981dadbfa0c8bbb424b69

    AtomBIOS: Distinguish between TV and normal DAC when reading out sensed status.
    
    AtomBIOS DAC load detection sets BIOS scratch register 0 bits to inform driver
    about connected hardware. When testing for TV out it doesn't reset the bits
    for normal DAC if these were set at previous measurements. So we need to make
    sure we only check for the bits set that concern us for our type of sense.

commit 174c2fc28fda1759150daf5c7a077bf55dbbc145
Author: Egbert Eich <eich@freedesktop.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 2 13:53:53 2008 +0200

    AtomBIOS: Make sure the OutputDriverPrivate is always set.
    
    To disable outputs we must make sure the output driver privates are
    always set, even when the output is not connected. This is done in the
    RandR detection function.
    The problem: AtomBIOS sense needs to know the device type to sense -
    which may be different from the device type currently set in the output
    private if the output can be used on more than one connector (like DACs).
    
    To overcome this we ask for the device type matching the connector in
    the sense function itself and discard it afterwards.
    If one output type was sensed on outputs that may have more than one
    output type we make sure to not sense again or overwrite the driver
    private with a different device type.
    
    For outouts that don't have anything connected we just leave the
    type that was set last.
    
    We really need to find the device type that's set at startup time.
    We may be able to do so using the BIOS scratch registers.
    However in this case we'd have to set the device type a lot later.

    Restructured OutputPrivates + numerous bug fixes.
    
    The output privates contain AtomBIOS device information.
    Which device to pick for a specific output isn't known however until we
    have probed the output.
    Also the object headers don't maintain the devices in the same order
    as the outputs in the src/dest table. We therefore need a heuristic
    to pick the correct device for an output.
    Along this numerous other bugs were fixed.

    I2C: Improve probing for monitor presence.
    
    The ASUS M2A-VM (RS690) motherboard comes in two variants: with and without
    HDMI. The HDMI variant ships with a riser card to be plugged into the PEG
    slot. Apart from this riser card both boards seem to be identical.
    When no riser card is installed all I2C slaves on the I2C line assigned to
    the HDMI connector send an ACK.
    Therefore to scheck fro the presence DDC it's not sufficient to look for
    the ACK but also to read the first two bytes and check if they belong to a
    DDC header.

    RandR: Santitize OrigMode passed to rhdRROutputModeFixup() but RandR.
    
    The SynthClock and Crtc values of this mode don't seem to be sane always.
    We zero them so that validation can take care of them later on.

    It still works with GNU and busybox sed, but now also works
    with FreeBSD sed.
    
    There is still an incompatibility with minised, though.

    MC: Tune MC on RV515 and RS690 to avoid glitches on hi res modes.
    
    To avoid glitches on Hi-Res modes due to linebuffer starvation
    the MC can get tuned to make linebuffer requests urgent when a
    timer has expired before the linebuffer has again obtained access
    to the framebuffer.
    This mechanism eists in this form in RV515 and derivatives
    as well as on RS690.
    Later chips implement a different mechanism.
    This initial implementation sets the timer to the lowest
    value pussible so the linebuffer becomes priority very early.
    An algorithm to estimate the correct value is on the TODO list.

    EXA: Get rid of static variables.
    
    In EXA variables carrying state between different accel functions have
    been made static. Static variables are generally not a good idea in
    X drivers as multiple instances of these drivers may exist.
    Although this may no matter in some use cases (ie. when static
    variables are only used to pass information between functions that
    are executed within the same drawing command) it's generally a good
    idea to avoid them.

    DRI: Adjust files to build against the drm kernel headers.
    
    The radeon_* files used header files with the same content
    as the kernel drm headers. This patch adds the necessary modifications
    to make those files build against the kernel header files.
    Since this driver can run with older API versions and it cannot
    be expected that all users have the latest drm header files
    installed it was necessary to copy radeon_drm.h from the kernel.
    Eventually this may also have to be done with sarea.h which however
    is hopefully less likely to change.
    This also does away with the insanity that different files built
    against different header files introduced with patch
    2f12947ba7a9d14760d229005b7cfc2f90bf022b.

    This variable describes the state of the 3D engine (if it is set up in
    the context of a DRI client or in the context of the Xserver).
    Thus it should live in the rhdAccel accel state structure.
    Also the name has been changed to XHas3DEngineState to be more
    self explanatory.

    DRI: Readd but comment out 2D init functions in rhd_dri.c.
    
    We might want to support 3D accel without 2D accel in the future.

    DRI: Keep rhdDri struct for server lifetime.
    
    This structure is allocated in PreInit() thus freeing it on
    CloseScreen() would provide the next server generation with
    no DRI support.

    DRI: Include kernel sarea.h and radeon_drm.h instead of radeon_sarea.h.
    
    The use if the kernel drm headers eliminates duplication of header
    information.
    This needs to be followed up for radeon_accel.c and radeon_exa.c.

    This variable is entierly used within the DRI subsystem. It can therefore
    be moved to the DRI structure.

    EXA: Remove RenderAccel from main driver struct.
    
    The RenderAccel code in XAA isn't used (commented out), in the EXA
    code this variable currently doesn't make sense as it is set to
    TRUE all the time.

    EXA: Consolidated further variables: accelDFS, gartLocation.
    
    If we can use accelerated download from screen can all be checked
    by looking for a valid address for gartLocation. This variable
    is set to an invalid value when the DRI driver structure is allocated
    and in DRICloseScreen().

    if many OS vendors are still shipping git packages with git-foo
    in the default PATH.
    
    The updated scripts using 'git foo' should still be compatible
    with git >= 1.3.0 with respect to the 'git foo' vs 'git-foo'
    issue, and with git >= 1.4.0 wrt the git commands themselves.

    In a normal build in src/ ("make", "make all"), ensure that the
    man page (man/radeonhd.man) is consistent with rhd_id.c.
    
    If this has required changing man/radeonhd.man, display an error
    message and abort the current build to notify the developer that
    he needs to add man/radeonhd.man to his next commit.
    
    The next build will always succeed unconditionally.

    git's sh scripts use $(), so if we have detected git we know there is
    a $() capable sh on board somewhere and can use it. Until then, we use
    `` and hope our quoting is a) correct and b) works even on those
    ancient sh implementations which may have problems with $().

    MC: never reread rhdPtr->FBIntAddress.
    
    The drm never really changes the FB location, just goes around in a circle.
    Actually changing the MC view of the FB would be insanity, as everything
    we do depends on this internal view. We nominated a value in PreInit, and
    then use this consistently.
    
    So:
    * remove the code to repetitively get this nominated value.
    * stop saving the offsets twice by saving them again in DRIFinishScreenInit.
    * tighten up the debug logging surrounding addressing.

    dri: Working DRI support for RS690
    
    DRI is not enabled by default, because this unconditionally disables 2D
    acceleration ATM.
    Fixed CP startup, 2D engine init, minor typo with major implications.
    Moved PCIe GART table at end of graphics aperture, because DRM seems to expect
    that:
      /* Initialize the memory controller. With new memory map, the fb location
       * is not changed, it should have been properly initialized already. Part
       * of the problem is that the code below is bogus, assuming the GART is
       * always appended to the fb which is not necessarily the case */
    
    Issue remaining:
    - Watermarks seem to be set wrong, display glitches when 3D is rendering.
    - MoveWindow not implemented. Considered unnecessary by me due to OpenGL specs.
    - Page Flipping not implemented yet.
    - Not working with acceleration yet.
    - Registers not saved/restored, to be done for Save/Restore to work.
    - Extreme ugliness of code.
    - Untested on other GPUs, but should(!) work fine on all r5xx with latest Mesa.

    PLL: On M54 do not re-enable Spread Spectrum.
    
    This fixes the flickering panel on a 1400x1050 t60, and is likely also
    the cause of the cycling colours reported on other M54s.

    Consolidate different mode validation functions.
    
    For the ScaledTo mode don't validate scaling (which will be done
    later once the scaled from mode is known) and don't validate
    against the FB (as this depends on the mode that determines the
    resolution).

    Fix heuristic for RR mode validation to find out about scaled mode.
    
    Also always attach scaledTo mode to rhd CRTC struct so we don't need to
    pass it around. The scaledTo mode is only used when the crtc specific
    scaling validation is available. Thus we can attach it there.
    
    Move collection of ScaledToMode to rhdRROutputGetModes(). This way the
    scaled to mode will be redetermined whenever a the output is reprobed.

    Move mode validation after scaler validation.
    
    This groups all validations that deal with actual timing parameters
    together. These validations affect the mode whose timing parameters are
    used ie the one that is set for the display.
    All validations which take place before scaler validation deal with
    fb parameters, thus deal with the mode which we scale from.
    In the situation where we use scaling the display mode is validated
    once and before any other mode list validation takes place.
    When the mode list is validated only the modes from which we scale
    from are only validated against fb and the scaler as those modes have
    no influence on the actual timing.

    Changed type of 'Type' variable for scaling from CARD32 to enum rhdCrtcScaleType.
    
    The scaling types used to be defines however those are dealt with entirely by
    a dump preprocessor. Enums have the benefit that they enjoy full lexical and
    sematic checking by the compiler. A lot of common errors can be caught and
    avoided that way.

    Dx_MODE overscan is for determining the destination window for scaling.
    It seems to be wrong to include a display overscan into this calculation.

    Move validation of scaled mode to RandrPreInit().
    
    The scaled mode needs to be validated before we use it for the
    first time. Unfortunately at this stage we cannot validate against
    the CRTC yet.
    Unfortunately when we can do this it's already too late.

    Move viewport size validation to the scaler validation callback.
    
    We don't validate the scaled up/down mode against the DxModeValid()
    as non of its timing parameters are used.
    Viewport size (ie H/VDisplay) are not really considered timing parameters.

    Add a per monitor native mode.
    
    The native mode should be the mode that coincides with the
    native resolution of a monitor. For an LCD this would be
    the number of horizontal and vertical pixel.
    On panels we assume it's either the higest resolution in
    an EDID block or the panel mode supplied by AtomBIOS.
    
    For any other monitor that can do DDC it's the first detailed
    timing if the monitor has the preferred mode flag bit set.

    'Tweak' frame rate of synthesized mode.
    
    Chances are that the native mode of a display is a CVT mode with 60 Hz.
    This will make RandR share the CRTC which is undesireable for scaling.
    This we 'tweak' the frequency to be slightly higher.
    Don't tell me it's ugly - I know this already.

    Attempt to fail modes if scaled mode is invalid.
    
    Unfortunately it has no effect if we fail a mode in rhdRROutputModeFixup().
    Instead we need to validate this mode earlier (before rhdRROutputModeValid()
    is called and add it to the rhdRandrOutputRec. From there we can pick it
    to create the timing mode in rhdRROutputModeFixup() and pass it as an
    additional argument to RHDRRModeFixup().

    Simplify and consolidate mode scaling.
    
    This makes handling and validation of scaled modes less intrusive:
    - scaling isn't directly a monitor property. In principle we can
      scale for any device. Thus we create a central policy function
      that decides based on monitor and connector information (currently).
    - In the non-RandR case we use the ScaledMode entry in the Crtc structure
      to identify if a mode is scaled or not. This value of this entry depends
      on the policy and the availability of a valid native resolution mode.
      The ScaledMode is obtained and validated before any other mode validation
      takes place. This is part of the layout selection process.
      If a scaledMode is available we only validate other modes against this
      one in the scaler validation as this mode controls the full timing.
    - In the RandR case we don't have access to the full mode list. Thus
      we synthesize modes from well known resolutions.
      Our outputFixup() code handles the validation much the same way
      as it is done in the non-RandR case.

    Add syntesized CVT modes to mode list for scaling.
    
    For RandR we need to synthesize modes for scaling as there is no way
    to obtain the full mode pool.
    We take a list of well known display resolutions and generate CVT
    mode lines from them. This is mainly done so that those modes can
    pass validation as we only need HDisplay and VDisplay from these.

    Add support for scaled video modes.
    
    Here mode validation will be done differently depending if we validate
    an unscaled or a mode that is to be scaled.
    From the mode that is to be scaled to a different display resolution we
    only need the viewport size, thus we only need to validate it against the
    scaler.
    Finding the true display mode to validate against is a little trickier:
    we look for the monitor that is to be attached and pick the preferred
    mode.

    Now we test the current owner of the given CRTC, and then temporarily
    enable it when needs be so a switch can take effect.

    Fix connector name when it is obvious that it's not DVI but VGA.
    
    This fix applies the same heuristic as in commit 3358d97 to the
    connector name synthetization. For connector tables from the
    supported device list this has already been taken care of so this
    is not strictly necessary. It's in here more as a save guard.

    Add heuristic to fix connector information when AtomBIOS wrongfully lists a VGA as DVI.
    
    AtomBIOS supported device lists sometimes list a VGA connector as a DVI. If we
    find a DVI connector with only one output attached, if this output is a DAC
    and there is no HDP we assume that we are dealing with a VGA connector.

    DAC A on R5/6xx doesn't seem to have a TV mode. The docs for RV620/635
    are less clear about this. So this still needs to be checked.

    PLL: Fix pll to crtc mapping.
    
    The multiplexer for this lives in the pll blocks and changes in pll to crtc
    mapping only take effect when the relevant pll is actually enabled.
    
    This fixes the long standing bug where attaching an external monitor to a
    laptop meant that the panel wouldn't be properly reinitialised when returning
    to VT.

    * A disabled PLL used to influence the enabled PLL when it was not
      restored properly.
    * DCCG restore handling was not in touch with current reality, and only
      thought about the future and therefor hardlocked the machine when
      specifically triggered. DCCG is painful, whatever it is.

    Add debugging aids.
    
    The RHDReg??D() functions can be used to print out the register
    values read/written. When RHD_DEBUG isn't define they will be
    identical to the versions without the 'D'.

    AtomBIOS contains information about temporal and spatial dithering
    as well as the number of grey levels emulated thru temporal dithering
    in the LVDS_Info table. If available use this information.

    Remove DVI_DUAL as a type which can be detected by load detection.
    
    Appearantly TMDS(A) load detection cannot be used to distringuish between
    single link and dual link DVI which would be useful to detect if someone
    erronously uses a single link DVI cable on a dual link capable monitor.

    TMDSA: Fix sensing with respect to duallink.
    
    Load detection is apparently sniffed at at ATI. So our only sense-able
    digital link is unable to find out whether we have proper duallink

    Setting this early makes this infornmation available to mode validation.
    Some limits may depend on the connector (example: dual link DVI has a

    Implement the hardware level scaling code.
    
    This is currently only useful for disabling scaling and for save and restore.
    The framework for enabling scaling is not implemented yet, so this code should
    not change driver functionality, just fix some modesetting issues we've come
    across.

    Restructure FMT block handling.
    
    The FMT block is directly linked to the CRTC block but only the ditital
    outputs seem to be connected to it. The FMT block preformats the pixel
    data for the display doing things like dithering which will give the
    impression of a higher color depth on 18bit digital displays.
    Since the FMT block is connected to the CRTC we save/restore it in the
    rhd_crtc.c while we program it from within DigMode().

    Fixing spelling in atombios.h generally isn't a good idea as it would

    Catalyst driver for example).
    Nontheless this fix was given to us by ATI.

    The verbosity level is used in many instances when we need to decide

    verbosity level we can avoid computational overhead when we are not
    going to print anything anyway.

    Changing R6XX_MC_VM_MISC_OFFSET to R6XX_HDP_NONSURFACE_BASE.
    
    HDP_NONSURFACE_BASE is the official ATI name.
    Originally we found this register in code tables called by AsicInit.
    It was given the name MC_VM_MISC_OFFSET because we didn't know the
    official name of it as we never received docs on it from ATI.
    
    Now it appeared in the 'radeon' driver under it's official name.

    Fully implement the SaveScreen() function.
    
    The argument to SaveScreen() is not simply on/off.
    xf86IsUnblank() needs to be called to actually match the
    DIX argument to on/off. Also the input timer needs to be
    reset on unblank. Furthermore the ScreenPtr may be NULL
    under certain circumstances thus it also needs to be checked
    before dereferencing.

    Fix blaning problem in bug #13853.
    
    RHDSaveScreen() is a DIX function. It gets called right from the DPMS
    extension. Non of the DIX function know anything about screen switching. Thus
    the protection of the hardware against accidental switches needs to come from
    the DDX (which includes the driver - if it provies functions which may be
    called from DIX directly).
    Adding a check for vtSema seems to fix the problem.

    Don't make assumptions about DDC clk line on RS690 when AtomBIOS is not available.
    
    Commit c900aa5 hardwired the DDC clock line to DDC2 when AtomBIOS was not
    available. This is definitely wrong. The 'default' in the switch statement
    meant as 'fall back to the one remaining possibility' (exactly as handled
    by AtomBIOS iself), not as the default value.
    This change hopefully eliminates any confusions.

    Change heuristics to check for an unPOSTed card.
    
    The code used to look for the location and size of the VRAM
    scratch area in the BIOS to determine if the device has been
    POSTed or not. This value reads 0 on unPOSTed BIOSes.
    This however is not true for all cards.
    Now we simply look where the BIOS has originated.

    Fix some issues when reading PCI ROM on POSTed systems.
    
    This stuff is rather magic.
    The SPI ROM interface needs to be set up. The SCK period
    needs to be set to be increased (power up default should be
    save).
    The GPIO pins seem to control the SPI ROM, so the GPIO pins
    must be set to be driven by hardware.

    18/24bit dithering breakage was spotted by Martin Nowack. He was not happy with

    Restore: Fix VGA textmode restore when VSYNC length is 0.
    
    When using the VGA emulation support, crtc VSYNC can be set to null, and the
    VGA timing will still apply. But when you save and then restore this value,
    things become very tricky, as the 0 length VSYNC provides bad sync timing and
    displays will then go into power saving.
    
    By setting the VSYNC to an acceptable value for a shortish time, the VGA engine
    apparently is able to latch in correctly, and as such the issue is seemingly
    fixed.
    
    I have no idea about a better solution for this issue, preferably one involving
    the VGA support itself, but this, although ugly, does seem to work.
    
    Denise H. G is very much resposible for fixing this issue, as she pointed out
    that a null value in VSYNC is the cause of the problem here.

    [PATCH] Avoid double -l when linking rhd_conntest
    
    If libpci is found via pkg-config, PCIUTILS_LIBS will contain
    something like "-L/path/to/lib -lpci -lz". So we get rid of the
    explicit -lpci and -lz in this case.
    
    In case pkg-config does not find libpci, though, we just revert
    to the previous behaviour of assuming that "-lpci -lz" will work.
    
    In any case, we make sure linking works before actually using it.

    [PATCH] Let pkg-config look for PCIUTILS/libpci
    
    Coleman Kane reports that on FreeBSD, libpci is installed at
    /usr/local, and so we'd need a -L/usr/local/lib. This switches
    the responsibility for detecting the libpci location to the
    libpci.pc file.

    Add panning in RandR mode.
    
    The panning area in RandR mode is specified by the geometry <w>x<h>[+<x>+<y>]
    in the RANDR_PANING_AREA output property (it actually is a Crtc-specific
    property, but RandR doesn't support that).
    
    As xrandr typically always resets the framebuffer size with every action,
    you will have to include --fb <w>x<h> on every invocation, unless there is an
    additional output configured with higher resolution.
    
    There is no static configuration for RANDR_PANING_AREA yet.

    Modes: Add DPI calculation.
    
    This adds code to provide useful DPI calculation. It follows a server argument,
    or uses the newly introduced option forcedpi, or tries to average out the DPI
    of the various monitors.
    
    This is of course a stopgap solution, as no DPI calculation can ever be valid
    throughout the whole server life, as it varies with varying resolutions and
    varying monitors. But at least it is better than having nothing at all.

    R600 LVDS is a rather big new thing, suddenly RS690M, M72, M74 and M76 devices.
    Next to that, there were quite a number of fixes.

    Both automake and imake builds keep existing git_version.h files if
    they detect the source tree is not a git workdir.

    Add potential RandR 1.3 output properties.
    
    This adds the following (immutable) properties to every output, as partially
    described for discussion in an randrproto.txt diff on xorg-devel:
    
    RANDR_SIGNAL_FORMAT
           Type:                   string
           Range/List:             unknown VGA TMDS LVDS FBAS SVideo
                                   YPbPr DisplayPort
           Signal format / physical protocol format that is used for the
           specified output.
           A driver MAY change this property of an output if the
           underlying hardware indicates a protocol change (e.g. TV
           formats).
    
    RANDR_CONNECTOR_TYPE
           Type:                   string
           Range/List:             unknown VGA DVI DVI-I DVI-A DVI-D HDMI
                                   internal TV TV-FBAS TV-SVideo TV-YPbPr
                                   TV-SCART TV-C4 DisplayPort
    
           Connector type, as far as known to the driver. Values with
           dashes (TV-FBAS) describe more specific versions of the base
           values (TV). The former SHOULD be used if the connector is not
           capable of producing other signal formats. The later SHOULD be
           used if the exact connector is unknown, or the connector is a
           multi-format connector that is not described otherwise.
           'internal' describes laptop-internal (normally LVDS) displays.
           'TV' and 'TV-SCART' with signal format 'VGA' are valid
           combinations and describe RGB TV signals.
    
    RANDR_CONNECTOR_NUMBER
           Type:                   int32
           Range/List:             0-
    
           Outputs that route their signal to the same connector MUST
           have the same connector number. Outputs with the same
           connector number MUST route their signal to the same
           connector, except if it is 0, which indicates unknown
           connectivity. 1 is called the primary connector, 2 the
           secondary. 3 is often a TV connector, but that is completely
           driver / hardware dependent.
           Outputs with the same connector number SHOULD have the same
           connector type. Meaning and client behavior for mismatching
           connector types is undefined at the moment.
    
    RANDR_OUTPUT_NUMBER
           Type:                   int32
           Range/List:             0-
    
           A card may route one internal output to several connectors.
           Connectors that are driven by the same output cannot be driven
           by different Crtcs and are thus only allowed to be used in
           clone mode. The driver SHOULD emit an error message and
           continue as gracefully as possible if using different Crtcs for
           the same internal output is requested.
           Internal outputs are numbered from 1, 0 indicates that output
           routing is unknown.

    Don't shut down outputs that have active connectors attached.
    
    Something that cannot be solved with the current RandR model is that multiple
    connectors might be attached to the same output. They cannot be driven with
    different crtcs then, but RandR sees them as different outputs because of a
    missing abstraction layer. This implementation will silently set one crtc or
    the other, and maybe even won't warn.

    The obvious approach to handle everything in rhdRROutputModeSet doesn't

    A normal "make" run on imake builds will not descend into
    utils/conntest/ any more. However, "xmkmf -a" still creates
    utils/conntest/Makefile from the Imakefile, so the user can
    "cd utils/conntest && make" to build rhd_conntest.

    Do NOT update virtualX/Y via rhdRRXF86CrtcResize callback.
    
    This is strange... if we set virtualX/virtualY like the intel driver does, we
    limit ourself in the future to this maximum size.
    The check for this is internally in RandR, no idea why the intel driver
    actually works this way...
    Even more curious: if we DON'T update virtual, everything seems to work as
    expected...

    RandR may give us a mode without a name - work around that.
    
    xf86RandRModeConvert sets mode->name to NULL - which lets our mode validation
    horribly fail. Copying the name from crtc->mode. This hopefully is not a
    memory leak, as the mode SHOULD be cleaned up.
    Modes can now be changed successfully.

    Don't include crtcs in check during mode_valid, only in fixup.
    
    If out-crtc is ever not NULL, it is not necessarily the Crtc that will be
    used, so it's better to skip crtc checks altogether...
    PLL in Crtc might now not be initialized when dpms is called. Ignore then.
    An crtc might already be assigned to an output, only assert for not being
    active then.

    Contains framework for RandR which doesn't really do anything but setting up
    data structures. All RandR Outputs get an individual, unique name that is
    composited from rhdConnector and rhdOutput.
    Contains also first functionality: Output probing.

    Be smarter about the monitor section by selectively ignoring it.
    
    Too many users are hitting this horribly outdated paradigm of one driver, one
    device, one monitor. Most of the configuration utilities out there still
    insist on creating a monitor section inside the config file, with a
    completely useless statement which enables DPMS which happens to be enabled
    per default anyway and cannot be disabled (the latter because of broken
    option handling in X dpms code).
    
    This hurts us because, when a handcreated monitor section is there, a sane
    driver should assume that this configured monitor is just there to add further
    restrictions to already known monitors, or to make up for lack of autodetected
    monitor information. This is why a driver should use this information.
    
    But apparently, the only real-world option is to ignore this section.
    Sanity doesn't count.
    
    So, new handling:
    * complain about monitor section if autodetected info is present.
    * use configured monitor if no autodetected info is present, fall back
      to default timing if no configured monitor is there.
    * option "useconfiguredmonitor" is there to enable the so desiring user
      to make the configured monitor matter in the autodetected case.
    
    Personally, i believe this to be overly complicated handling, and wrong.
    It's the third millenium, we can have multiple monitors already.

    With the usage of the AtomBIOS provided connector information
    chances are high that unknown cards are working.
    In this case users only need to contact developers if the driver
    doesn't work or doesn't work optimally.

    Fix fixable warnings.
    
    Commit 8699deaba2c added a list of compiler warnings which
    lead to a lot of noise during build.
    Non of the issues found seemed to be really relevant, still
    this patch attempts to fix all the issues that could be address:
    - comparisons between signed and unsigned.
    - unreachable code: unreachable return statement.
    - shadowing of global symbols (don't use 'index' as a symbol!).
    - order of static and const.
    
    Other issues cannot be fixed:
    - when functions are inlined some code paths in the function might
      be unreachable. The compiler should deal with this but not warn!
    - enums in a switch statement. gcc braindeadlessly complains even
      if there is a default: case.

    Implement PCI BIOS access reenablement to read BIOS from ROM BAR on POSTed systems.
    
    Once a RadeonHD chip has been POSTed it is no longer possible to read
    its PCI ROM from the mapped ROM BAR.
    For secondary cards this will mean they can only be used once after boot.
    Once the Xserver that has POSTed it has terminated the PCI ROM copy of
    the BIOS is lost.
    To be able to reread the BIOS image the driver needs to do some VOODOO
    to reenable access to the PCI ROM BAR.
    Support for R5xx still needs further testing and is therefore disabled by
    default.

    We now cycle through the EDID provided modes list to find reduced blanking
    modes. If found, the driver will now allow reduced blanking for this

    In case this still fails, we now have Option "ForceReduced", to force
    reduced blanking on all or no monitors.

    Don't call GetRec in PreInit() in the PCIACCESS case.
    
    The driver private is already allocated in Probe for the PCIACCESS case
    (leaving behind a memory leak when the driver isn't used afterwards).
    We don't have to call it in PreInit() (which would be harmless, though).

    Cleaning up the EDID confusion: only free the EDID block when not needed.
    
    To make things clearer, the EDID block passed from AtomBIOS is
    no in a structure element called EDIDBlock (as opposed to EDID).

    Card ID based workaround for MCS-59 connector.
    
    MCS-59 to 2x vga adapters do not assert the HPD pin. Therefor
    we need to provide a connector table ourselves, so that at least
    DACs will be tested appropriately.

    Fix enabling of Monitor->ReducedAllowed.
    
    * Now we properly handle reduced on TDMSA and LVTMA even when EDID
      doesn't tell us as such or when no EDID is used. This fixes the
      issue where we tried to set the panel mode on an external device
      which might not allow reduced.
    * Sync check in rhdMonitorValid is now reworked to have saner
      limits. This was much overdue as the other one, the one still
      in xfree86/common/xf86Modes.c was pretty awkward.
    * Logging of monitors and modes was also slightly adjusted.
    * And then a memleak in handling the atom provided panel mode
      information was fixed.

    Make sure that config.h is included in every file that includes rhd.h.
    
    rhd.h contains structures that are different wether
    libpciaccess is used or not.
    Therefore we need to include config.h before rhd.h.
    To avoid double inclusions of headers we don't include
    it in rhd.h itself but check there if the define for
    it is set. If not we simply error on build.

    Set 'HaveDriverFuncs' AddDriver(), use base_addr instead of bus_addr for mapping.
    
    'HaveDriverFuncs' is required so that AddDriver picks up the full
    DriverRec. (I should have know that since I designed it - although
    its original purpose, a backward compatible ABI has been defeated
    anyhow).
    regions[BAR]->base_addr seems to hold the base if the PCI range
    (relative to bus_addr).

    Change CombineStrings() to AppendString().
    
    The semantics have changed. Now the first string is deallocated
    in some sense following realloc(). When the first element is NULL
    a new string will be created (like with strdup()). When the second
    string is NULL the first one will be returned unaltered. The
    same will happen in an out of memory condition.

    So far the I2C code assumed that there are always 4 I2C

    though.
    We now only initialize the ones the hardware supports.

    Getting PLL limits from AtomBIOS.
    
    AtomBIOS has information about the PLL_IN min/max VCO min/max and
    pixel clock max frequency.
    As the VCO_min frequency in AtomBIOS is 0 in most BIOSes that have
    been checked the code uses a fixed value of 600MHz for now.
    
    Also the names of the variables have been modified to match the
    nomenclature of atombios.h better.

    Found some more reasonable function names for some.
    Some whitespace cleanup.
    Added missing rhdRestoreCursor() prototype.

    Mainly reverted commit 0a546480a5c2e0c66f746a91cb0b5f592c06b357.
    
    This mixed up save & restore.
    Save is used for saving GPU state when *entering* the Xserver, Restore for
    restoring the old state when leaving. That includes the cursor (there could be
    a cursor active on VTs - though unlikely).
    Upon entering we save state, then *reload* the cursor image we just *know* to
    be correct. No need for saving that on LeaveVT.

    Don't validate the duty cycle on fixed device provided modes.
    
    Modes provided by the device itself should not be validated
    against common display standards. Most validations can be
    circumvented by not passing ranges to validate against.
    This is not true for the dutry cycle.
    While a 10 percent duty cycle seems low for a CRT device
    (which should not be below 20 percent) it may too high for
    modern display panels.

        Fix cursor vt switch handling including segfault.
    
        Save() and Restore() are used to save and restore text mode.
        Therefore we cannot call CursorSave() and CursorRestore()
        from Save() and Restore() if we want to restore the cursor when
        vt-switching back to X.
        Cursor->StoreAddress read from D1CUR_SURFACE_ADDRESS does
        not hold the cursor image offset with respect to the framebuffer
        start but with respect to the memory address 0.
        Using it as an offset causes segfault.

    The R5xx I2CWriteRead() function didn't handle the case
    where neither write nor read data is available correctly.
    In this situation only the slave address should be written.
    R5xx appearantly cannot deal with a one byte slave address
    and zero data bytes. Therefore we write one dummy byte
    (i.e. an index value) after the address.

    Added a scanbus option to scan all i2c buses on all lines.
    
    Alongside with this the build was fixed that broke
    due to previous merges.
    All AtomBIOS and I2C functions now take a scrnIndex
    instead of a ScrnInfoRec as argument since all subsystems
    carry only the scrnIndex as a link to the 'world' in their
    private structures.

    we remove the call for now.
    Also make sure the framebuffer is mapped if we need it for AtomBIOS

    The following functional blocks have been fixed with this
    patch:
    - I2C: DDC read out has been added and tested on R6XX.
    - AtomBIOS:
      * Some structural changes were made to accomodate
        AtomBIOS execuiton better.
      * Execution of AtomBIOS was successfully tested with
        ReadHWAssistedEDID().
      * Support for ASIC Init was added.

    Initial version of I2C handling code for R5xx and R6xx.
    
    R6xx I2C support should be pretty complete.
    R5xx I2C support suffers from the lack of documentation.
    Currently we don't have full specs for R5xx
    therefore the code there is very preliminary.

    Add connector handling.
    
    Connectors tie the actual plug, a monitor of any description, a ddc bus
    a hot plug detect pin, and (currently) up to two outputs together.
    
    So, everything comes together here, and the connector handling decides
    how and when which monitors and which outputs and which CRTCs are tied
    together.
    
    This requires an entry in our card table to map out these connectors
    for various hardware, another lengthy and painful plugfest...
    Which isn't complete yet, so your hardware might not start just yet.

    The flag HARDWARE_CURSOR_ARGB is used by the new RandR 1.2
    layer. It's not available on earlier versions nor is it

    Depend on rhdPtr->CursorInfo instead of rhdPtr->swCursor.val.bool.
    
    This is much safer. Plus, when RHDCursorInit fails we don't need to bail out,
    as we can happily fall back to the software cursor.

    Fix includes for cursor.
    
    By not depending on the xf86Cursor typedef and using the struct * instead, we
    don't need to include xf86Cursor.h all over the place. This tactic means that
    we will never have to spend ages resolving inter-header dependencies and makes
    us more resilient against unrelated SDK/API changes.

    Remove the RHDRegRead/Write/Mask dependence on rhdPtr.
    
    RHDRegRead/Write/Mask now take scrnIndex as their first argument. This
    ensures that, when structuring modesetting, we don't need to cast back
    to rhdPtr all the time to be able to touch registers.

    * Add rhdPtr->scrnIndex and move all modesetting functions to take rhdPtr
      as a first argument.
    * Add a workaround for __func__ on systems that don't provide this
    * Create RHDDebug function for debug messages (-logverbose 7).
    * Create RHDFUNC macro to print function names to the log when debugging.
      This might once again seem superfluous, but it is easier to tell a user
      to provide a log of -logverbose 7 than to have them run gdb.
    * Improve messaging to use __func__, RHDDebug and RHDFUNC.

    Add one or two pci ids...
    
    We had a delivery of AMD hardware, so we had a bit of a plugfest. This means
    that we now have a grand total of 15 unique devices at our disposal.
    
    Then boiko@mandriva dug up a pci id listing from ATI, which kind of bumped
    the number of possible R5xx/R6xx devices up to a cosy 99.
    
    We need to order more hardware.
    
    So:
    * Add to RHD_CHIPSETS, RHDChipsets, and RHDPCIchipsets.
    * Create a function to mark the "few" cards we can't test as experimental,
      which means that the driver will complain and bail.
    * Add Option "EXPERIMENTAL", to stop the driver from bailing.
    * Add PCI card/subsystem id checking; only prints the card name now.
    * Remove rhd_macro.h as RHDPTR() should live near the definition of RHDPtr.
    * Move a few other defines, like RHD_NAME, to rhd.h.

    This is where Atom stores the size. This size is checked against the size of
    the PCI BAR aperture (which is limited to 512MB), and the smallest of the
    two is chosen.
    Also removes the superfluous BAR selection crap, uses 2 defines instead. Will
    reintroduce logic when it is actually needed.

    Now D1 (D1GRPH, D1CRTC and D1PLL) points to DACA and D2 (D2GRPH, D2CRTC and

    overly useful, but we have a working starting point.

    Single entry point to ATOM BIOS subsystem.
    
    The entry point to the ATOM BIOS subsystem is now
    a single function:
    AtomBiosResult RhdAtomBIOSFunc(ScrnInfoPtr pScrn, pointer handle, AtomBiosFunc func,
    		    AtomBIOSArgPtr data);
    Apart from pScrn the arguments are:
     'handle' (a struct with persistent internal data),
    typedef enum {
        ATOMBIOS_INIT,
        ATOMBIOS_UNINIT,
        ...
        FUNC_END
    } AtomBiosFunc;
    which describes the action to perform.
    Before any other action can be performed ATOMBIOS_INIT needs
    to be called. It will create and return the 'handle' which
    needs to be passed for any subsequent operations.
    
    it can return the states:
    typedef enum {
        SUCCESS,
        FAILED,
        NOT_IMPLEMENTED
    } AtomBiosResult;
    
    The 4th argument is a pointer to a union
    that can be used to pass arguments to and
    results from the function.
    The most common data types are already in the union,
    more elaborate structures can be passed back and
    forth by using the ptr member.

    The failure case was still not handled correctly:
    MMIO should get unmapped and the BIOS handler private data
    structures should be freed on failure. (If the latter ones
    will be needed in ScreenInit() in the future we can keep
    them around and point to them from the driver private data
    structure.

    Track option set status.
    
    Presently there is no consistent way of tracking if an option
    was set by the user or has been set to the default value.
    This information may be needed later to make more educated
    decisions on how to proceed.
    Many drivers work around this problem in different ways - often
    by introducing a second driver private variable to track the
    option status.
    We add a set of functions and a new structure to handle this
    in a more consistent way.
    These functions should eventually be moved to DDX.
    For now we leave them in the driver.

        Use the default method to specify VRAM size.
    
        The DDX already provides a device section option to specify
        the size of VRAM. The GDevRec is linked into the entity info.
        Therefore we pick up this value before we free this structure.
    
        In the future we may have to keep the entity info around for
        longer. But we will also have a way to reliably probe VRAM size
        in which case we may not want to pick up a user specified setting
        at all.
        The exact policy can however determined later.

    There was one place where it was not used correctly, and the entity pointer
    is not needed anymore after PCI resources have been claimed. In future, other
    things will have to be handled when bailing out of PreInit later on, things
    which need more code than a macro should have. If the extra work involved is
    that much of a burden, then this is about the only case where a goto is
    accepted, especially by the otherwise very picky kernel community.
