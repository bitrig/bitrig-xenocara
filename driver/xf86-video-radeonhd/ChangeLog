    Remove DVI_DUAL as a type which can be detected by load detection.
    
    Appearantly TMDS(A) load detection cannot be used to distringuish between
    single link and dual link DVI which would be useful to detect if someone
    erronously uses a single link DVI cable on a dual link capable monitor.

    Load detection is apparently sniffed at at ATI. So our only sense-able

    Setting this early makes this infornmation available to mode validation.
    Some limits may depend on the connector (example: dual link DVI has a

    Properly restore Encoder and Transmitter.
    
    This patch attempts to follow the set procedure to restore encoder and
    transmitter values. Not doing this doesn't seem to make any difference
    here, but we never know...

    Implement the hardware level scaling code.
    
    This is currently only useful for disabling scaling and for save and restore.
    The framework for enabling scaling is not implemented yet, so this code should
    not change driver functionality, just fix some modesetting issues we've come
    across.

    Restructure FMT block handling.
    
    The FMT block is directly linked to the CRTC block but only the ditital
    outputs seem to be connected to it. The FMT block preformats the pixel
    data for the display doing things like dithering which will give the
    impression of a higher color depth on 18bit digital displays.
    Since the FMT block is connected to the CRTC we save/restore it in the
    rhd_crtc.c while we program it from within DigMode().

    going to print anything anyway.

    HDP_NONSURFACE_BASE is the official ATI name.
    Originally we found this register in code tables called by AsicInit.
    It was given the name MC_VM_MISC_OFFSET because we didn't know the
    official name of it as we never received docs on it from ATI.
    
    Now it appeared in the 'radeon' driver under it's official name.

    Fully implement the SaveScreen() function.
    
    The argument to SaveScreen() is not simply on/off.
    xf86IsUnblank() needs to be called to actually match the
    DIX argument to on/off. Also the input timer needs to be
    reset on unblank. Furthermore the ScreenPtr may be NULL
    under certain circumstances thus it also needs to be checked
    before dereferencing.

    Fix blaning problem in bug #13853.
    
    RHDSaveScreen() is a DIX function. It gets called right from the DPMS
    extension. Non of the DIX function know anything about screen switching. Thus
    the protection of the hardware against accidental switches needs to come from
    the DDX (which includes the driver - if it provies functions which may be
    called from DIX directly).
    Adding a check for vtSema seems to fix the problem.

    Don't make assumptions about DDC clk line on RS690 when AtomBIOS is not available.
    
    Commit c900aa5 hardwired the DDC clock line to DDC2 when AtomBIOS was not
    available. This is definitely wrong. The 'default' in the switch statement
    meant as 'fall back to the one remaining possibility' (exactly as handled
    by AtomBIOS iself), not as the default value.
    This change hopefully eliminates any confusions.

    save).
    The GPIO pins seem to control the SPI ROM, so the GPIO pins
    must be set to be driven by hardware.

    Restore: Fix VGA textmode restore when VSYNC length is 0.
    
    When using the VGA emulation support, crtc VSYNC can be set to null, and the
    VGA timing will still apply. But when you save and then restore this value,
    things become very tricky, as the 0 length VSYNC provides bad sync timing and
    displays will then go into power saving.
    
    By setting the VSYNC to an acceptable value for a shortish time, the VGA engine
    apparently is able to latch in correctly, and as such the issue is seemingly
    fixed.
    
    I have no idea about a better solution for this issue, preferably one involving
    the VGA support itself, but this, although ugly, does seem to work.
    
    Denise H. G is very much resposible for fixing this issue, as she pointed out
    that a null value in VSYNC is the cause of the problem here.

    [PATCH] Avoid double -l when linking rhd_conntest
    
    If libpci is found via pkg-config, PCIUTILS_LIBS will contain
    something like "-L/path/to/lib -lpci -lz". So we get rid of the
    explicit -lpci and -lz in this case.
    
    In case pkg-config does not find libpci, though, we just revert
    to the previous behaviour of assuming that "-lpci -lz" will work.
    
    In any case, we make sure linking works before actually using it.

    [PATCH] Let pkg-config look for PCIUTILS/libpci
    
    Coleman Kane reports that on FreeBSD, libpci is installed at
    /usr/local, and so we'd need a -L/usr/local/lib. This switches
    the responsibility for detecting the libpci location to the
    libpci.pc file.

    Add panning in RandR mode.
    
    The panning area in RandR mode is specified by the geometry <w>x<h>[+<x>+<y>]
    in the RANDR_PANING_AREA output property (it actually is a Crtc-specific
    property, but RandR doesn't support that).
    
    As xrandr typically always resets the framebuffer size with every action,
    you will have to include --fb <w>x<h> on every invocation, unless there is an
    additional output configured with higher resolution.
    
    There is no static configuration for RANDR_PANING_AREA yet.

    Modes: Add DPI calculation.
    
    This adds code to provide useful DPI calculation. It follows a server argument,
    or uses the newly introduced option forcedpi, or tries to average out the DPI
    of the various monitors.
    
    This is of course a stopgap solution, as no DPI calculation can ever be valid
    throughout the whole server life, as it varies with varying resolutions and
    varying monitors. But at least it is better than having nothing at all.

    Handle MCRead/Write differently.
    
    AtomBIOS puts the enable mask for MC accesses into the top
    byte of a word, while the MC index register has them in the
    upper word a double word.
    Do the transformation in the CAIL function.

    Fix memory offset for R6xx.
    
    Some 512Meg VBIOSes map the upper portion of the
    memory to the memory aperture exposed to the PCI
    BAR.
    This makes sure we always map the lower portion
    on R6xx.

Date:   Fri Nov 16 20:33:40 2007 +0100

    Add potential RandR 1.3 output properties.
    
    This adds the following (immutable) properties to every output, as partially
    described for discussion in an randrproto.txt diff on xorg-devel:
    
    RANDR_SIGNAL_FORMAT
           Type:                   string
           Range/List:             unknown VGA TMDS LVDS FBAS SVideo
                                   YPbPr DisplayPort
           Signal format / physical protocol format that is used for the
           specified output.
           A driver MAY change this property of an output if the
           underlying hardware indicates a protocol change (e.g. TV
           formats).
    
    RANDR_CONNECTOR_TYPE
           Type:                   string
           Range/List:             unknown VGA DVI DVI-I DVI-A DVI-D HDMI
                                   internal TV TV-FBAS TV-SVideo TV-YPbPr
                                   TV-SCART TV-C4 DisplayPort
    
           Connector type, as far as known to the driver. Values with
           dashes (TV-FBAS) describe more specific versions of the base
           values (TV). The former SHOULD be used if the connector is not
           capable of producing other signal formats. The later SHOULD be
           used if the exact connector is unknown, or the connector is a
           multi-format connector that is not described otherwise.
           'internal' describes laptop-internal (normally LVDS) displays.
           'TV' and 'TV-SCART' with signal format 'VGA' are valid
           combinations and describe RGB TV signals.
    
    RANDR_CONNECTOR_NUMBER
           Type:                   int32
           Range/List:             0-
    
           Outputs that route their signal to the same connector MUST
           have the same connector number. Outputs with the same
           connector number MUST route their signal to the same
           connector, except if it is 0, which indicates unknown
           connectivity. 1 is called the primary connector, 2 the
           secondary. 3 is often a TV connector, but that is completely
           driver / hardware dependent.
           Outputs with the same connector number SHOULD have the same
           connector type. Meaning and client behavior for mismatching
           connector types is undefined at the moment.
    
    RANDR_OUTPUT_NUMBER
           Type:                   int32
           Range/List:             0-
    
           A card may route one internal output to several connectors.
           Connectors that are driven by the same output cannot be driven
           by different Crtcs and are thus only allowed to be used in
           clone mode. The driver SHOULD emit an error message and
           continue as gracefully as possible if using different Crtcs for
           the same internal output is requested.
           Internal outputs are numbered from 1, 0 indicates that output
           routing is unknown.

    ID: Fix up Macbook pro.
    
    This one has a rather awkward atombios connector table and requires an id based
    workaround.
    
    Thanks to Jerome Glisse.

    Don't shut down outputs that have active connectors attached.
    
    Something that cannot be solved with the current RandR model is that multiple
    connectors might be attached to the same output. They cannot be driven with
    different crtcs then, but RandR sees them as different outputs because of a
    missing abstraction layer. This implementation will silently set one crtc or
    the other, and maybe even won't warn.

    The obvious approach to handle everything in rhdRROutputModeSet doesn't

    "cd utils/conntest && make" to build rhd_conntest.

    Do NOT update virtualX/Y via rhdRRXF86CrtcResize callback.
    
    This is strange... if we set virtualX/virtualY like the intel driver does, we
    limit ourself in the future to this maximum size.
    The check for this is internally in RandR, no idea why the intel driver
    actually works this way...
    Even more curious: if we DON'T update virtual, everything seems to work as
    expected...

    RandR may give us a mode without a name - work around that.
    
    xf86RandRModeConvert sets mode->name to NULL - which lets our mode validation
    horribly fail. Copying the name from crtc->mode. This hopefully is not a
    memory leak, as the mode SHOULD be cleaned up.
    Modes can now be changed successfully.

    Don't include crtcs in check during mode_valid, only in fixup.
    
    If out-crtc is ever not NULL, it is not necessarily the Crtc that will be
    used, so it's better to skip crtc checks altogether...
    PLL in Crtc might now not be initialized when dpms is called. Ignore then.
    An crtc might already be assigned to an output, only assert for not being
    active then.

    Added Mode Validation and necessary dummy functions.
    
    This doesn't work correctly yet, because modes are still set from rhd_driver.c.

    Initial RandR framework.
    
    Contains framework for RandR which doesn't really do anything but setting up
    data structures. All RandR Outputs get an individual, unique name that is
    composited from rhdConnector and rhdOutput.
    Contains also first functionality: Output probing.

    Be smarter about the monitor section by selectively ignoring it.
    
    Too many users are hitting this horribly outdated paradigm of one driver, one
    device, one monitor. Most of the configuration utilities out there still
    insist on creating a monitor section inside the config file, with a
    completely useless statement which enables DPMS which happens to be enabled
    per default anyway and cannot be disabled (the latter because of broken
    option handling in X dpms code).
    
    This hurts us because, when a handcreated monitor section is there, a sane
    driver should assume that this configured monitor is just there to add further
    restrictions to already known monitors, or to make up for lack of autodetected
    monitor information. This is why a driver should use this information.
    
    But apparently, the only real-world option is to ignore this section.
    Sanity doesn't count.
    
    So, new handling:
    * complain about monitor section if autodetected info is present.
    * use configured monitor if no autodetected info is present, fall back
      to default timing if no configured monitor is there.
    * option "useconfiguredmonitor" is there to enable the so desiring user
      to make the configured monitor matter in the autodetected case.
    
    Personally, i believe this to be overly complicated handling, and wrong.
    It's the third millenium, we can have multiple monitors already.

    Fix fixable warnings.
    
    Commit 8699deaba2c added a list of compiler warnings which
    lead to a lot of noise during build.
    Non of the issues found seemed to be really relevant, still
    this patch attempts to fix all the issues that could be address:
    - comparisons between signed and unsigned.
    - unreachable code: unreachable return statement.
    - shadowing of global symbols (don't use 'index' as a symbol!).
    - order of static and const.
    
    Other issues cannot be fixed:
    - when functions are inlined some code paths in the function might
      be unreachable. The compiler should deal with this but not warn!
    - enums in a switch statement. gcc braindeadlessly complains even
      if there is a default: case.

    Implement PCI BIOS access reenablement to read BIOS from ROM BAR on POSTed systems.
    
    Once a RadeonHD chip has been POSTed it is no longer possible to read
    its PCI ROM from the mapped ROM BAR.
    For secondary cards this will mean they can only be used once after boot.
    Once the Xserver that has POSTed it has terminated the PCI ROM copy of
    the BIOS is lost.
    To be able to reread the BIOS image the driver needs to do some VOODOO
    to reenable access to the PCI ROM BAR.
    Support for R5xx still needs further testing and is therefore disabled by
    default.

    In case this still fails, we now have Option "ForceReduced", to force
    reduced blanking on all or no monitors.

    Let AtomBIOS layer convert variables to correct unit.
    
    To reduce the size of variables AtomBIOS rescales values.
    The AtomBIOS layer should rescale the values before passing
    it to other layers.

    Don't call GetRec in PreInit() in the PCIACCESS case.
    
    The driver private is already allocated in Probe for the PCIACCESS case
    (leaving behind a memory leak when the driver isn't used afterwards).
    We don't have to call it in PreInit() (which would be harmless, though).

    Cleaning up the EDID confusion: only free the EDID block when not needed.
    
    To make things clearer, the EDID block passed from AtomBIOS is
    no in a structure element called EDIDBlock (as opposed to EDID).

    Card ID based workaround for MCS-59 connector.
    
    MCS-59 to 2x vga adapters do not assert the HPD pin. Therefor
    we need to provide a connector table ourselves, so that at least
    DACs will be tested appropriately.

    Fix enabling of Monitor->ReducedAllowed.
    
    * Now we properly handle reduced on TDMSA and LVTMA even when EDID
      doesn't tell us as such or when no EDID is used. This fixes the
      issue where we tried to set the panel mode on an external device
      which might not allow reduced.
    * Sync check in rhdMonitorValid is now reworked to have saner
      limits. This was much overdue as the other one, the one still
      in xfree86/common/xf86Modes.c was pretty awkward.
    * Logging of monitors and modes was also slightly adjusted.
    * And then a memleak in handling the atom provided panel mode
      information was fixed.

    Make sure that config.h is included in every file that includes rhd.h.
    
    rhd.h contains structures that are different wether
    libpciaccess is used or not.
    Therefore we need to include config.h before rhd.h.
    To avoid double inclusions of headers we don't include
    it in rhd.h itself but check there if the define for
    it is set. If not we simply error on build.

    Set 'HaveDriverFuncs' AddDriver(), use base_addr instead of bus_addr for mapping.
    
    'HaveDriverFuncs' is required so that AddDriver picks up the full
    DriverRec. (I should have know that since I designed it - although
    its original purpose, a backward compatible ABI has been defeated
    anyhow).
    regions[BAR]->base_addr seems to hold the base if the PCI range
    (relative to bus_addr).

    Change CombineStrings() to AppendString().
    
    The semantics have changed. Now the first string is deallocated
    in some sense following realloc(). When the first element is NULL
    a new string will be created (like with strdup()). When the second
    string is NULL the first one will be returned unaltered. The
    same will happen in an out of memory condition.

    Only initialize I2C buses which are really available in HW.
    
    So far the I2C code assumed that there are always 4 I2C
    buses available in hardware. The R5xx only supports 3,
    though.
    We now only initialize the ones the hardware supports.

    AtomBIOS has information about the PLL_IN min/max VCO min/max and
    pixel clock max frequency.
    As the VCO_min frequency in AtomBIOS is 0 in most BIOSes that have
    been checked the code uses a fixed value of 600MHz for now.
    
    Also the names of the variables have been modified to match the
    nomenclature of atombios.h better.

    Call RHDMonitorInit() even if there is no DDC for the Connector.
    
    We don't solely depend on DDC any more to get mode for a
    connector. For panels we may use data pulled from AtomBIOS.
    Therefore we handle this inside RHDMonitorInit().

    Cursor cleanup: Nuke export of bit-banging interface.
    
    These functions were never intended to be called outside cursor.c, or to be
    overloaded. Calling function pointers also disables inlining by the compiler.
    Found some more reasonable function names for some.
    Some whitespace cleanup.
    Added missing rhdRestoreCursor() prototype.

    Mainly reverted commit 0a546480a5c2e0c66f746a91cb0b5f592c06b357.
    
    This mixed up save & restore.
    Save is used for saving GPU state when *entering* the Xserver, Restore for
    restoring the old state when leaving. That includes the cursor (there could be
    a cursor active on VTs - though unlikely).
    Upon entering we save state, then *reload* the cursor image we just *know* to
    be correct. No need for saving that on LeaveVT.

    Don't validate the duty cycle on fixed device provided modes.
    
    Modes provided by the device itself should not be validated
    against common display standards. Most validations can be
    circumvented by not passing ranges to validate against.
    This is not true for the dutry cycle.
    While a 10 percent duty cycle seems low for a CRT device
    (which should not be below 20 percent) it may too high for
    modern display panels.

        Fix cursor vt switch handling including segfault.
    
        Save() and Restore() are used to save and restore text mode.
        Therefore we cannot call CursorSave() and CursorRestore()
        from Save() and Restore() if we want to restore the cursor when
        vt-switching back to X.
        Cursor->StoreAddress read from D1CUR_SURFACE_ADDRESS does
        not hold the cursor image offset with respect to the framebuffer
        start but with respect to the memory address 0.
        Using it as an offset causes segfault.

Author: Egbert Eich <eich@freedesktop.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 27 21:38:16 2007 +0200

    Put scaler value in hex.

commit 651e776d2cd9aaaef4782e6cf600cc35cc0c9cc7
Author: Egbert Eich <eich@freedesktop.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 27 21:29:02 2007 +0200

    Fixed I2C probing on R5xx.
    
    The R5xx I2CWriteRead() function didn't handle the case
    where neither write nor read data is available correctly.
    In this situation only the slave address should be written.
    R5xx appearantly cannot deal with a one byte slave address
    and zero data bytes. Therefore we write one dummy byte
    (i.e. an index value) after the address.

commit fe08f8e56f97697012e77ccf5f28ccb0adfcee19
Author: Egbert Eich <eich@freedesktop.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 27 21:25:26 2007 +0200

    Fixed order of magnitude of SCL, added correct prescale calculation for R6xx.
    
    R6xx should be in kHz units.
    The I2C prescale value is the ratio of the XTAL clock (reference clock)
    to the SCL clock. The reference clock value is read from AtiomBIOS.

commit b5ec5d2cc84b0017a1bc49fe6d9809343c6824cc
Author: Egbert Eich <eich@freedesktop.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 27 21:11:54 2007 +0200

    Adding AtomBIOS support to conntest.
    
    Engine and XTAL frequencies are kept in AtomBIOS tables.
    These values are required to calculate DDC clocks correctly.
    This patch also fixes a typo which caused all DDC lines
    on R6xx to report a connected DDC slave.

    Adding AMD Copyright. Fix build to build with atombios.h but without parser.
    
    The license situation for the AtomBIOS parser has not yet been
    fixed. So the initial release will be without it.
    We comment all the code that relies on it.

    Added a scanbus option to scan all i2c buses on all lines.
    
    Alongside with this the build was fixed that broke
    due to previous merges.
    All AtomBIOS and I2C functions now take a scrnIndex
    instead of a ScrnInfoRec as argument since all subsystems
    carry only the scrnIndex as a link to the 'world' in their
    private structures.

    ASIC_Init messes up the initialization at the moment therefore
    we remove the call for now.
    Also make sure the framebuffer is mapped if we need it for AtomBIOS
    calls.

    The following functional blocks have been fixed with this
    patch:
    - I2C: DDC read out has been added and tested on R6XX.
    - AtomBIOS:
      * Some structural changes were made to accomodate
        AtomBIOS execuiton better.
      * Execution of AtomBIOS was successfully tested with
        ReadHWAssistedEDID().
      * Support for ASIC Init was added.
      * Better Debug support was added.
    - Int10:
      * Int10 support was added. Secondary cards POST
        flawlessly.

    Initial version of I2C handling code for R5xx and R6xx.
    
    R6xx I2C support should be pretty complete.
    R5xx I2C support suffers from the lack of documentation.
    Currently we don't have full specs for R5xx
    therefore the code there is very preliminary.

    Add connector handling.
    
    Connectors tie the actual plug, a monitor of any description, a ddc bus
    a hot plug detect pin, and (currently) up to two outputs together.
    
    So, everything comes together here, and the connector handling decides
    how and when which monitors and which outputs and which CRTCs are tied
    together.
    
    This requires an entry in our card table to map out these connectors
    for various hardware, another lengthy and painful plugfest...
    Which isn't complete yet, so your hardware might not start just yet.

    The flag HARDWARE_CURSOR_ARGB is used by the new RandR 1.2
    layer. It's not available on earlier versions nor is it
    required. Therefore we check for its presence before we use
    it.

    PLL: Invert Post divider selection logic.
    
    To choose the highest possible internal PLL frequency, this to improve the
    stability of the output PLL.
    Also add handling for EXTx_PPLL_CNTL, this adds voltage handling for PLLs for
    the r600s. For r500s, this is handled by ASIC_RegistersInit in atombios.

    Depend on rhdPtr->CursorInfo instead of rhdPtr->swCursor.val.bool.
    
    This is much safer. Plus, when RHDCursorInit fails we don't need to bail out,
    as we can happily fall back to the software cursor.

    Fix includes for cursor.
    
    By not depending on the xf86Cursor typedef and using the struct * instead, we
    don't need to include xf86Cursor.h all over the place. This tactic means that
    we will never have to spend ages resolving inter-header dependencies and makes
    us more resilient against unrelated SDK/API changes.

    Remove the RHDRegRead/Write/Mask dependence on rhdPtr.
    
    RHDRegRead/Write/Mask now take scrnIndex as their first argument. This
    ensures that, when structuring modesetting, we don't need to cast back
    to rhdPtr all the time to be able to touch registers.

    * Add rhdPtr->scrnIndex and move all modesetting functions to take rhdPtr
      as a first argument.
    * Add a workaround for __func__ on systems that don't provide this
    * Create RHDDebug function for debug messages (-logverbose 7).
    * Create RHDFUNC macro to print function names to the log when debugging.
      This might once again seem superfluous, but it is easier to tell a user
      to provide a log of -logverbose 7 than to have them run gdb.
    * Improve messaging to use __func__, RHDDebug and RHDFUNC.

    Add one or two pci ids...
    
    We had a delivery of AMD hardware, so we had a bit of a plugfest. This means
    that we now have a grand total of 15 unique devices at our disposal.
    
    Then boiko@mandriva dug up a pci id listing from ATI, which kind of bumped
    the number of possible R5xx/R6xx devices up to a cosy 99.
    
    We need to order more hardware.
    
    So:
    * Add to RHD_CHIPSETS, RHDChipsets, and RHDPCIchipsets.
    * Create a function to mark the "few" cards we can't test as experimental,
      which means that the driver will complain and bail.
    * Add Option "EXPERIMENTAL", to stop the driver from bailing.
    * Add PCI card/subsystem id checking; only prints the card name now.
    * Remove rhd_macro.h as RHDPTR() should live near the definition of RHDPtr.
    * Move a few other defines, like RHD_NAME, to rhd.h.

    This is where Atom stores the size. This size is checked against the size of
    the PCI BAR aperture (which is limited to 512MB), and the smallest of the
    two is chosen.
    Also removes the superfluous BAR selection crap, uses 2 defines instead. Will
    reintroduce logic when it is actually needed.

    Now D1 (D1GRPH, D1CRTC and D1PLL) points to DACA and D2 (D2GRPH, D2CRTC and
    D2PLL) points to DACB. And all seems to work. It's not exactly refined or
    overly useful, but we have a working starting point.

    Single entry point to ATOM BIOS subsystem.
    
    The entry point to the ATOM BIOS subsystem is now
    a single function:
    AtomBiosResult RhdAtomBIOSFunc(ScrnInfoPtr pScrn, pointer handle, AtomBiosFunc func,
    		    AtomBIOSArgPtr data);
    Apart from pScrn the arguments are:
     'handle' (a struct with persistent internal data),
    typedef enum {
        ATOMBIOS_INIT,
        ATOMBIOS_UNINIT,
        ...
        FUNC_END
    } AtomBiosFunc;
    which describes the action to perform.
    Before any other action can be performed ATOMBIOS_INIT needs
    to be called. It will create and return the 'handle' which
    needs to be passed for any subsequent operations.
    
    it can return the states:
    typedef enum {
        SUCCESS,
        FAILED,
        NOT_IMPLEMENTED
    } AtomBiosResult;
    
    The 4th argument is a pointer to a union
    that can be used to pass arguments to and
    results from the function.
    The most common data types are already in the union,
    more elaborate structures can be passed back and
    forth by using the ptr member.

    The failure case was still not handled correctly:
    MMIO should get unmapped and the BIOS handler private data
    structures should be freed on failure. (If the latter ones
    will be needed in ScreenInit() in the future we can keep
    them around and point to them from the driver private data
    structure.

    Track option set status.
    
    Presently there is no consistent way of tracking if an option
    was set by the user or has been set to the default value.
    This information may be needed later to make more educated
    decisions on how to proceed.
    Many drivers work around this problem in different ways - often
    by introducing a second driver private variable to track the
    option status.
    We add a set of functions and a new structure to handle this
    in a more consistent way.
    These functions should eventually be moved to DDX.
    For now we leave them in the driver.

        Use the default method to specify VRAM size.
    
        The DDX already provides a device section option to specify
        the size of VRAM. The GDevRec is linked into the entity info.
        Therefore we pick up this value before we free this structure.
    
        In the future we may have to keep the entity info around for
        longer. But we will also have a way to reliably probe VRAM size
        in which case we may not want to pick up a user specified setting
        at all.
        The exact policy can however determined later.

    Move option handling.
    
    There is no HW cursor yet, so don't bother.

    Remove BAILOUT macro.
    
    There was one place where it was not used correctly, and the entity pointer
    is not needed anymore after PCI resources have been claimed. In future, other
    things will have to be handled when bailing out of PreInit later on, things
    which need more code than a macro should have. If the extra work involved is
    that much of a burden, then this is about the only case where a goto is
    accepted, especially by the otherwise very picky kernel community.

    Skeleton for a driver for the ATI RADEON HD series Chipsets
    
    This skeleton driver still lacks support for
    - acceleration
    - RandR 1.2
    - multiple screens
    It still needs to undergo some restructuring as we go along.
