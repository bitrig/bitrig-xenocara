<sect>Reported Working Video Cards

  <item>XPERT 99 AGP 8MB
</itemize>


<sect>Configuration
<p>
The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
section of your xorg.conf file are:
<verb>
       Section "Device"
           Identifier "Rage 128"
           Driver     "r128"
       EndSection
</verb>
or let <tt>xorgconfig</tt> do this for you.

However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:
<itemize>
  <item>VideoRam - in kilobytes
  <item>MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
  <item>IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers
  <item>ChipID   - PCI DEVICE ID
</itemize>


<sect>Driver Options
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>"hw_cursor" - request hardware cursor (default)
  <item>"sw_cursor" - software cursor only
  <item>"no_accel"  - software rendering only
  <item>"dac_8_bit" - use color weight 888 in 8 bpp mode (default)
  <item>"dac_6_bit" - use color weight 666 in 8 bpp mode (VGA emulation)
</itemize>


<sect>Known Limitations
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>None
