.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to __xconfigfile__(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.
.PP
The driver auto\-detects all device information necessary to initialize
the card.  However, if you have problems with auto\-detection, you can
specify:
.PP
.RS 4
VideoRam \- in kilobytes
.br
MemBase  \- physical address of the linear framebuffer
.br
IOBase   \- physical address of the MMIO registers
.br
ChipID   \- PCI DEVICE ID
.RE
.PP
In addition, the following driver
.B Options
are supported:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSWcursor\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Selects software cursor.  The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoAccel\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enables or disables all hardware acceleration.
.br
The default is to
.B enable
hardware acceleration.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDac6Bit\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enables or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when in 8 bpp
mode (emulates VGA mode).  By default, all 8 bits per color component
are used.
.br
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qVideoKey\*q \*q" integer \*q
This overrides the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
.br
The default value is
.B 0x1E.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qScalerWidth\*q \*q" integer \*q
This sets the overlay scaler buffer width. Accepted values range from 1024 to
2048, divisible by 64, values other than 1536 and 1920 may not make sense
though. Should be set automatically, but noone has a clue what the limit is
for which chip. If you think quality is not optimal when playing back HD video
(with horizontal resolution larger than this setting), increase this value, if
you get an empty area at the right (usually pink), decrease it. Note this only
affects the "true" overlay via xv, it won't affect things like textured video.
.br
The default value is either 1536 (for most chips) or 1920.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAGPMode\*q \*q" integer \*q
Set AGP data transfer rate.
(used only when DRI is enabled)
.br
1      \-\- 1x (before AGP v3 only)
.br
2      \-\- 2x (before AGP v3 only)
.br
4      \-\- 4x
.br
8      \-\- 8x (AGP v3 only)
.br
others \-\- invalid
.br
The default is to
.B leave it unchanged.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAGPFastWrite\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable AGP fast writes.  Enabling this is frequently the cause of
instability. Used only when the DRI is enabled. If you enable
this option you will get *NO* support from developers.
.br
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qBusType\*q \*q" string \*q
Used to replace previous ForcePCIMode option.
Should only be used when driver's bus detection is incorrect
or you want to force a AGP card to PCI mode. Should NEVER force
a PCI card to AGP bus.
.br
PCI    \-\- PCI bus
.br
AGP    \-\- AGP bus
.br
PCIE   \-\- PCI Express (falls back to PCI at present)
.br
(used only when DRI is enabled)
.br
The default is
.B auto detect.
.TP 
.BI "Option \*qDDCMode\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Force to use the modes queried from the connected monitor.
.br
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDisplayPriority\*q \*q" string \*q
.br
Used to prevent flickering or tearing problem caused by display buffer underflow.
.br
AUTO   \-\- Driver calculated (default).
.br
BIOS   \-\- Remain unchanged from BIOS setting.
          Use this if the calculation is not correct
          for your card.
.br
HIGH   \-\- Force to the highest priority.
          Use this if you have problem with above options.
          This may affect performance slightly.
.br
The default value is
.B AUTO.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qColorTiling\*q \*q" "boolean" \*q
Frame buffer can be addressed either in linear or tiled mode. Tiled mode can provide
significant performance benefits with 3D applications, for 2D it shouldn't matter
much. Tiling will be disabled if the virtual x resolution exceeds 2048 (3968 for R300 
and above), if option
.B UseFBDev
is used, or (if DRI is enabled) the drm module is too old.
.br
If this option is enabled, a new dri driver is required for direct rendering too.
.br
Color tiling will be automatically disabled in interlaced or doublescan screen modes.
.br
The default value is
.B on.
.TP 
.BI "Option \*qIgnoreEDID\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Do not use EDID data for mode validation, but DDC is still used
for monitor detection. This is different from NoDDC option.
.br
The default value is
.B off.
.TP 
.BI "Option \*qPanelSize\*q \*q" "string" \*q
Should only be used when driver cannot detect the correct panel size.
Apply to both desktop (TMDS) and laptop (LVDS) digital panels.
When a valid panel size is specified, the timings collected from
DDC and BIOS will not be used. If you have a panel with timings 
different from that of a standard VESA mode, you have to provide
this information through the Modeline.
.br
For example, Option "PanelSize" "1400x1050"
.br
The default value is
.B none.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEnablePageFlip\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable page flipping for 3D acceleration. This will increase performance
but not work correctly in some rare cases, hence the default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qForceMinDotClock\*q \*q" frequency \*q
Override minimum dot clock. Some Radeon BIOSes report a minimum dot
clock unsuitable (too high) for use with television sets even when they
actually can produce lower dot clocks. If this is the case you can
override the value here.
.B Note that using this option may damage your hardware.
You have been warned. The
.B frequency
parameter may be specified as a float value with standard suffixes like
"k", "kHz", "M", "MHz".
.TP
.BI "Option \*qRenderAccel\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enables or disables hardware Render acceleration.  This driver does not
support component alpha (subpixel) rendering.  It is only supported on
Radeon series up to and including 9200 (9500/9700 and newer
unsupported).  The default is to
.B enable
Render acceleration.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAccelMethod\*q \*q" "string" \*q
Chooses between available acceleration architectures.  Valid options are
.B XAA
and
.B EXA.
XAA is the traditional acceleration architecture and support for it is very
stable.  EXA is a newer acceleration architecture with better performance for
the Render and Composite extensions, but the rendering code for it is newer and
possibly unstable.  The default is
.B XAA.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAccelDFS\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Use or don't use accelerated EXA DownloadFromScreen hook when possible (only
when Direct Rendering is enabled, e.g.).
Default:
.B off
with AGP due to issues with GPU->host transfers with some AGP bridges,
.B on
otherwise.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qFBTexPercent\*q \*q" integer \*q
Amount of video RAM to reserve for OpenGL textures, in percent. With EXA, the
remainder of video RAM is reserved for EXA offscreen management. Specifying 0
results in all offscreen video RAM being reserved for EXA and only GART memory
being available for OpenGL textures. This may improve EXA performance, but
beware that it may cause problems with OpenGL drivers from Mesa versions older
than 6.4. With XAA, specifying lower percentage than what gets reserved without
this option has no effect, but the driver tries to increase the video RAM
reserved for textures to the amount specified roughly.
Default:
.B 50.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDepthBits\*q \*q" integer \*q
Precision in bits per pixel of the shared depth buffer used for 3D acceleration.
Valid values are 16 and 24. When this is 24, there will also be a hardware
accelerated stencil buffer, but the combined depth/stencil buffer will take up
twice as much video RAM as when it's 16.
Default:
.B The same as the screen depth.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDMAForXv\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Try or don't try to use DMA for Xv image transfers. This will reduce CPU
usage when playing big videos like DVDs, but may cause instabilities.
Default:
.B on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSubPixelOrder\*q \*q" "string" \*q
Force subpixel order to specified order.
Subpixel order is used for subpixel decimation on flat panels.
.br
NONE   \-\- No subpixel (CRT like displays)
.br
RGB    \-\- in horizontal RGB order (most flat panels)
.br
BGR    \-\- in horizontal BGR order (some flat panels)

.br
This option is intended to be used in following cases:
.br
1. The default subpixel order is incorrect for your panel.
.br
2. Enable subpixel decimation on analog panels.
.br
3. Adjust to one display type in dual-head clone mode setup.
.br
4. Get better performance with Render acceleration on 
digital panels (use NONE setting).
.br
The default is 
.B NONE 
for CRT, 
.B RGB 
for digital panels
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDynamicClocks\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable dynamic clock scaling.  The on-chip clocks will scale dynamically 
based on usage. This can help reduce heat and increase battery 
life by reducing power usage.  Some users report reduced 3D performance
with this enabled.  The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qVGAAccess\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Tell the driver if it can do legacy VGA IOs to the card. This is
necessary for properly resuming consoles when in VGA text mode, but
shouldn't be if the console is using radeonfb or some other graphic
mode driver. Some platforms like PowerPC have issues with those, and they aren't
necessary unless you have a real text mode in console. The default is
.B off
on PowerPC and SPARC and
.B on
on other architectures.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qReverseDDC\*q \*q" boolean \*q
When BIOS connector informations aren't available, use this option to
reverse the mapping of the 2 main DDC ports. Use this if the X serve
obviously detects the wrong display for each connector. This is
typically needed on the Radeon 9600 cards bundled with Apple G5s. The
default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qLVDSProbePLL\*q \*q" boolean \*q
When BIOS panel informations aren't available (like on PowerBooks), it
may still be necessary to use the firmware provided PLL values for the
panel or flickering will happen. This option will force probing of
the current value programmed in the chip when X is launched in that
case.  This is only useful for LVDS panels (laptop internal panels).
The default is
.B on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVDACLoadDetect\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable load detection on the TV DAC.  The TV DAC is used to drive both 
TV-OUT and analog monitors. Load detection is often unreliable in the 
TV DAC so it is disabled by default.
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDefaultTMDSPLL\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Use the default driver provided TMDS PLL values rather than the ones
provided by the bios. This option has no effect on Mac cards.  Enable 
this option if you are having problems with a DVI monitor using the 
internal TMDS controller.
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDefaultTVDACAdj\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Use the default driver provided TVDAC Adj values rather than the ones
provided by the bios. This option has no effect on Mac cards.  Enable 
this option if you are having problems with a washed out display on 
the secondary DAC.
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDRI\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable DRI support.  This option allows you to enable to disable the DRI.  
The default is
.B off 
for RN50/ES1000 and
.B on 
for others.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDefaultConnectorTable\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable this option to skip the BIOS connector table parsing and use the
driver defaults for each chip.  
The default is
.B off 
.TP
.BI "Option \*qMacModel\*q \*q" string \*q
.br
Used to specify Mac models for connector tables and quirks.  If you have
a powerbook or mini with DVI that does not work properly, try the alternate
 options as Apple does not seem to provide a good way of knowing whether
 they use internal or external TMDS for DVI.  Only valid on PowerPC.
.br
ibook                \-\- ibooks
.br
powerbook-external   \-\- Powerbooks with external DVI
.br
powerbook-internal   \-\- Powerbooks with integrated DVI
.br
powerbook-vga        \-\- Powerbooks with VGA rather than DVI
.br
powerbook-duallink   \-\- powerbook-external alias
.br
powerbook            \-\- powerbook-internal alias
.br
mini-external        \-\- Mac Mini with external DVI
.br
mini-internal        \-\- Mac Mini with integrated DVI
.br
mini                 \-\- mini-external alias
.br
imac-g5-isight       \-\- iMac G5 iSight
.br
The default value is
.B undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVStandard\*q \*q" string \*q
.br
Used to specify the default TV standard if you want to use something other than
the bios default. Valid options are:
.br
ntsc
.br
pal
.br
pal-m
.br
pal-60
.br
ntsc-j
.br
scart-pal
.br
The default value is
.B undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qForceTVOut\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable this option to force TV Out to always be detected as attached.
The default is
.B off 
.TP
.BI "Option \*qIgnoreLidStatus\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable this option to ignore lid status on laptops and always detect
LVDS as attached.
The default is
.B on. 
.TP
.BI "Option \*qInt10\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option allows you to disable int10 initialization.  Set this to 
False if you are experiencing a hang when initializing a secondary card.
The default is
.B on.
