This directory contains a copy of the mode and parser code from RandR 1.2.

If you are building from git and you don't have xorg-server-1.3 or higher or you
want to be able to make dist, you should create symlinks to the modes and parser
directories from a RandR 1.2-enabled server here:

  $ ln -s /path/to/xorg/xserver/hw/xfree86/{modes,parser} .
