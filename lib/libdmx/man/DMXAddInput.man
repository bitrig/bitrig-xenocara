.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DMXAddInput()
is used to attach a new input (or a previously detached input) to the
.BR Xdmx (1)
server.
.I mask
specifies the fields in
.I attr
that are active, and
.I id
returns the device if of the first device in the series that is added.
.PP
The value of
.I mask
is computed from the following values:
.sp
.nf
DMXInputType
DMXInputPhysicalScreen
DMXInputSendsCore
.fi
.PP
The
.B DMXInputAttributes
structure is:
.sp
.nf
typedef struct {
    DMXInputEnum inputType;
    int          physicalScreen;
    int          physicalId;
    Bool         isCore;
    Bool         sendsCore;
    const char   *name;
    Bool         detached;
} DMXInputAttributes;
.fi
.PP
.I inputType
may bave the value
.B DmxConsoleInputType " or " DmxBackendInputType .
.PP
For console devices,
.I name
will specify the display to be used.
.PP
For back-end devices,
.I physicalScreen
will specify the
.BR Xdmx (1)
screen number.
.PP
If
.I sendsCore
is
.BR True ,
the new device will be added as a true core device.
.PP
If a device was removed with
.BR DMXRemoveInput (__libmansuffix__)
an attempt will be made to reconnect the previous devices
.RI ( sendsCore
is ignored in this case).
.PP
.B DMXAddBackendInput()
is a helper function that is used to add input from a back-end server.
With this function,
.I screen
refers to the back-end screen,
.I sendsCore
is
.B True
if the new input should send core events (and it ignored if the input
has been detached), and
.I newId
will hold the device id of the first device in the series added.
.PP
.B DMXAddConsoleInput()
is a helper function that is used to add input from a console.  With
this function,
.I name
is the name of the console display,
.I sendsCore
is
.B True
if the new input should send core events (and it ignored if the input
has been detached), and
.I newId
will hold the device id of the first device in the series added.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B DMXAddInput()
returns
.B True
on success and
.B False
otherwise.
.PP
.B DMXAddInput()
can generate
.B BadValue
(if
.I inputType
is invalid or
.I physicalScreen
is out of range),
.B BadAccess
(if the input has already been attached or if the backend screen is
currently detached).
.SH NOTES
Local devices cannot be attached or detached.
.PP
Attributes that are not specified will default to 0.  This may lead to
unintended results.
