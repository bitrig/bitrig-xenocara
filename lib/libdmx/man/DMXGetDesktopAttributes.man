} DMXDesktopAttributes;
.fi
.PP
The size of the global bounding box is given in
.IR width ", and " height .
The
.IR shiftX " and " shiftY
values will always be 0.  The global bounding box is computed whether or
not Xinerama is active, but it is only useful when using Xinerama.
.PP
The global bounding box used by
.BR Xdmx (1)
may be larger than the Xinerama screen size because of information in
the configuration file.
