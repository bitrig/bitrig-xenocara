.SH NAME
DMXGetScreenCount \- determine number of back-end screens
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <X11/extensions/dmxext.h>
.sp
.nf
.BI "Bool DMXGetScreenCount(Display " *dpy ,
.BI "                       int " *screen_count );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DMXGetScreenCount()
returns the number of back-end screens that a
.BR Xdmx (1)
server controls.  Since a DMX screen usually fills all of the available
area on a back-end server, there is usually a one-to-one correspondence
between DMX screens and backend servers.  However, it is also possible
for a DMX screen to cover only part of the available area on a back-end
server, and for more than one DMX screens to occupy different parts of
the visible area on the same back-end server.
.PP
A DMX screen may be managed as a regular X screen in the
.BR Xdmx (1)
server or may be joined with other DMX screens using Xinerama.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B DMXGetScreenCount()
sets
.I screen_count
and returns
.B True
unless there is a protocol error.
.SH NOTES
If Xinerama is active, only one logical screen will be available to
clients of the
.BR Xdmx (1)
server.  However, this call will accurately reflect the number of
composite back-end screens that the
.BR Xdmx (1)
server is using.
