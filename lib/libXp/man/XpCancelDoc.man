.TH XpCancelDoc 3Xp __xorgversion__ "XPRINT FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XpCancelDoc \-  Cancels a print document.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B void XpCancelDoc
(
.I display,
.I discard
)
.br
      Display *\fIdisplay\fP\^;
.br
      Bool \fIdiscard\fP\^;
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I display
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay.
.TP
.I discard
When TRUE, specifies that all XPPrintNotify events with a detail of 
XPEndPageNotify or 
XPEndDocNotify should be discarded.     
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
XpCancelDoc cancels an in-progress document. If the job was started with 
output_mode XPGetData 
then the data stream to 
XpGetDocumentData is interrupted; no further data for the current document will 
be generated 
but data for subsequent documents can be 
generated. For many page description languages such arbitrary termination may 
invalidate the 
output.

If the job was started with output_mode XPSpool then depending on the driver and 
spooler 
implementation the entire document may be 
canceled or a partial document may be generated.

If 
.I discard 
is True all XPPrintNotify events with a detail field of XPEndPageNotify or 
XPEndDocNotify are discarded before XpCancelDoc 
returns.

For clients selecting XPPrintMask (see XpSelectInput), the event XPPrintNotify 
will be 
generated with its detail field set to 
XPEndDocNotify.
