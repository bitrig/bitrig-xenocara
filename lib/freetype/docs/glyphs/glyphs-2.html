          <h2>II. Glyph Outlines</h2>

          <p>This section describes the way scalable representations
            of glyph images, called outlines, are used by FreeType as
            well as client applications.</p>

          <h3 id="section-1">1. Pixels, points and device
            resolutions</h3>

          <p>Though it is a very common assumption when dealing with
            computer graphics programs, the physical dimensions of a
            given pixel (be it for screens or printers) are not
            squared.  Often, the output device, be it a screen device
            or a printer, exhibits varying resolutions in both
            horizontal and vertical directions, and this must be taken
            care of when rendering text.</p>

          <p>It is thus common to define a device's characteristics
            through two numbers expressed in <em>dpi</em> (dots per
            inch).  For example, a printer with a resolution of
            300&times;600&nbsp;dpi has 300&nbsp;pixels per inch in the
            horizontal direction, and 600 in the vertical one.  The
            resolution of a typical computer monitor varies with its
            size (10&Prime;&nbsp;and 25&Prime;&nbsp;monitors don't
            have the same pixel sizes at 1024&times;768), and of
            course the graphics mode resolution.</p>

          <p>As a consequence, the size of text is usually given in
            <em>points</em>, rather than device-specific pixels.
            Points are a <em>physical</em> unit, where 1&nbsp;point
            equals 1/72th of an inch in digital typography.  As an
            example, most books using the Latin script are printed
            with a body text size somewhere between 10 and
            14&nbsp;points.</p>

          <p>It is thus possible to compute the size of text in pixels
            from the size in points with the following formula:</p>

          <center>
            <tt>pixel_size = point_size * resolution / 72</tt>
          </center>

          <p>The resolution is expressed in <em>dpi</em>.  Since
            horizontal and vertical resolutions may differ, a single
            point size usually defines a different text width and
            height in pixels.</p>

          <p><em>Unlike what is often thought, the &lsquo;size of text
              in pixels&rsquo; is not directly related to the real
              dimensions of characters when they are displayed or
              printed.  The relationship between these two concepts is
              a bit more complex and depend on some design choices
              made by the font designer.  This is described in more
              detail in the next sub-section (see the explanations on
              the EM square).</em></p>


          <h3 id="section-2">2. Vectorial representation</h3>

          <p>The source format of outlines is a collection of closed paths called
            <em>contours</em>.  Each contour delimits an outer or
            inner <em>region</em> of the glyph, and can be made of
            either <em>line segments</em> or <em>B&eacute;zier
            arcs</em>.</p>

          <p>The arcs are defined through <em>control points</em>, and
            can be either second-order (these are <em>conic</em>
            B&eacute;ziers) or third-order (<em>cubic</em>
            B&eacute;ziers) polynomials, depending on the font format.
            Note that conic B&eacute;ziers are usually called
            <em>quadratic</em> B&eacute;ziers in the literature.
            Hence, FreeType associates each point of the outline with
            flag to indicate its type (normal or control point).  And
            scaling the points will scale the whole outline.</p>

          <p>Each glyph's original outline points are located on a
            grid of indivisible units.  The points are usually stored
            in a font file as 16-bit integer grid coordinates, with
            the grid's origin being at (0,0); they thus range from
            -32768 to&nbsp;32767.  (Even though point coordinates can
            be floats in other formats such as Type&nbsp;1, we will
            restrict our analysis to integer values for
            simplicity).</p>

          <p><em>The grid is always oriented like the traditional
              mathematical two-dimensional plane, i.e.,
              the <i>X</i>&nbsp;axis goes from the left to the right,
              and the <i>Y</i>&nbsp;axis from bottom to top.</em></p>
        
          <p>In creating the glyph outlines, a type designer uses an
            imaginary square called the <em>EM square</em>.
            Typically, the EM square can be thought of as a tablet on
            which the characters are drawn.  The square's size, i.e.,
            the number of grid units on its sides, is very important
            for two reasons:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>It is the reference size used to scale the outlines
                to a given text dimension.  For example, a size of
                12pt at 300&times;300&nbsp;dpi corresponds to
                12*300/72&nbsp;=&nbsp;50&nbsp;pixels.  This is the
                size the EM square would appear on the output device
                if it was rendered directly.  In other words, scaling
                from grid units to pixels uses the formula:</p>

              <p align="center">
                <tt>pixel_size = point_size * resolution / 72</tt><br>
                <tt>pixel_coord = grid_coord * pixel_size / EM_size</tt>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The greater the EM size is, the larger resolution the
                designer can use when digitizing outlines.  For
                example, in the extreme example of an EM size of
                4&nbsp;units, there are only 25&nbsp;point positions
                available within the EM square which is clearly not
                enough.  Typical TrueType fonts use an EM size of
                2048&nbsp;units; Type&nbsp;1 or CFF PostScript fonts
                traditionally use an EM size of 1000&nbsp;grid units
                (but point coordinates can be expressed as floating
                values).</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Note that glyphs can freely extend beyond the EM square
            if the font designer wants so.  The EM square is thus just
            a convention in traditional typography.</p>

          <p>Grid units are very often called <em>font units</em>
            or <em>EM units</em>.</p>

          <p><em>As said before, <tt>pixel_size</tt> computed in the
              above formula does not directly relate to the size of
              characters on the screen.  It simply is the size of the
              EM square if it was to be displayed.  Each font designer
              is free to place its glyphs as it pleases him within the
              square.  This explains why the letters of the following
              text have not the same height, even though they are
              displayed at the same point size with distinct
              fonts:</em></p>

          <p align="center">
            <img src="body_comparison.png"
                 height="40"
                 width="580"
                 alt="Comparison of font heights">
          </p>

          <p>As one can see, the glyphs of the Courier family are
            smaller than those of Times New Roman, which themselves
            are slightly smaller than those of Arial, even though
            everything is displayed or printed at a size of
            16&nbsp;points.  This only reflects design choices.</p>


          <h3 id="section-3">3. Hinting and Bitmap rendering</h3>

          <p>The outline as stored in a font file is called the
            &lsquo;master&rsquo; outline, as its points coordinates
            are expressed in font units.  Before it can be converted
            into a bitmap, it must be scaled to a given size and
            resolution.  This is done with a very simple
            transformation, but always creates undesirable artifacts,
            in particular stems of different widths or heights in
            letters like &lsquo;E&rsquo; or &lsquo;H&rsquo;.</p>

          <p>As a consequence, proper glyph rendering needs the scaled
            points to be aligned along the target device pixel grid,
            through an operation called <em>grid-fitting</em> (often
            called <em>hinting</em>).  One of its main purposes is to
            ensure that important widths and heights are respected
            throughout the whole font (for example, it is very often
            desirable that the &lsquo;I&rsquo; and the &lsquo;T&rsquo;
            have their central vertical line of the same pixel width),
            as well as to manage features like stems and overshoots,
            which can cause problems at small pixel sizes.</p>

          <p>There are several ways to perform grid-fitting properly;
            most scalable formats associate some control data or
            programs with each glyph outline.  Here is an
            overview:</p>

          <ul>
            <li class="emph">
              <p>explicit grid-fitting</p>

              <p>The TrueType format defines a stack-based virtual
                machine, for which programs can be written with the
                help of more than 200&nbsp;opcodes (most of them
                relating to geometrical operations).  Each glyph is
                thus made of both an outline and a control program to
                perform the actual grid-fitting in the way defined by
                the font designer.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="emph">
              <p>implicit grid-fitting (also called hinting)</p>

              <p>The Type&nbsp;1 and CFF formats take a much simpler
                approach: Each glyph is made of an outline as well as
                several pieces called <em>hints</em> which are used to
                describe some important features of the glyph, like
                the presence of stems, some width regularities, and
                the like.  There aren't a lot of hint types, and it is
                up to the final renderer to interpret the hints in
                order to produce a fitted outline.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="emph">
              <p>automatic grid-fitting</p>

              <p>Some formats include no control information with each
                glyph outline, apart from font metrics like the
                advance width and height.  It is then up to the
                renderer to &lsquo;guess&rsquo; the more interesting
                features of the outline in order to perform some
                decent grid-fitting.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The following table summarizes the pros and cons of each
            scheme.</p>
