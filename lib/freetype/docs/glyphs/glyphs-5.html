    <p>This section demonstrates how to use the concepts previously defined
    to render text, whatever the layout you use.</p>


    <a name="section-1">
    <h3>
      1. Writing simple text strings
    </h3>

    <p>In this first example, we will generate a simple string of Roman
    text, i.e. with a horizontal left-to-right layout.  Using exclusively
    pixel metrics, the process looks like:

    <tt>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Convert the character string into a series of glyph
          indices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the pen to the cursor position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get or load the glyph image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translate the glyph so that its 'origin' matches the pen position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Render the glyph to the target device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increment the pen position by the glyph's advance width in pixels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start over at step&nbsp3 for each of the remaining glyphs.
        </li>
        <li>
          When all glyphs are done, set the text cursor to the new pen
          position.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </tt>

    <p>Note that kerning isn't part of this algorithm.</p>


    <a name="section-2">
    <h3>
      2. Sub-pixel positioning
    </h3>

    <p>It is somewhat useful to use sub-pixel positioning when rendering
    text.  This is crucial, for example, to provide semi-WYSIWYG text
    layouts.  Text rendering is very similar to the algorithm described in
    subsection&nbsp;1, with the following few differences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The pen position is expressed in fractional pixels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because translating a hinted outline by a non-integer distance will
        ruin its grid-fitting, the position of the glyph origin must be
        rounded before rendering the character image.
      </li>
      <li>
        The advance width is expressed in fractional pixels, and isn't
        necessarily an integer.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here an improved version of the algorithm:</p>

    <tt>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Convert the character string into a series of glyph
          indices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the pen to the cursor position.  This can be a non-integer
          point.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get or load the glyph image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translate the glyph so that its "origin" matches the rounded pen
          position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Render the glyph to the target device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increment the pen position by the glyph's advance width in
          fractional pixels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start over at step&nbsp;3 for each of the remaining glyphs.
        </li>
        <li>
          When all glyphs are done, set the text cursor to the new pen
          position.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </tt>

    <p>Note that with fractional pixel positioning, the space between two
    given letters isn't fixed, but determined by the accumulation of
    previous rounding errors in glyph positioning.</p>


    <a name="section-3">
    <h3>
      3. Simple kerning
    </h3>

    <p>Adding kerning to the basic text rendering algorithm is easy: When a
    kerning pair is found, simply add the scaled kerning distance to the pen
    position before step&nbsp;4.  Of course, the distance should be rounded
    in the case of algorithm&nbsp;1, though it doesn't need to for
    algorithm&nbsp;2.  This gives us:</p>

    <p>Algorithm&nbsp;1 with kerning:</p>

    <tt>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Convert the character string into a series of glyph
          indices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the pen to the cursor position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get or load the glyph image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the rounded scaled kerning distance, if any, to the pen
          position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translate the glyph so that its "origin" matches the pen position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Render the glyph to the target device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increment the pen position by the glyph's advance width in pixels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start over at step&nbsp;3 for each of the remaining glyphs.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </tt>

    <p>Algorithm&nbsp;2 with kerning:</p>

    <tt>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Convert the character string into a series of glyph
          indices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the pen to the cursor position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get or load the glyph image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the scaled unrounded kerning distance, if any, to the pen
          position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translate the glyph so that its "origin" matches the rounded pen
          position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Render the glyph to the target device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increment the pen position by the glyph's advance width in
          fractional pixels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start over at step&nbsp;3 for each of the remaining glyphs.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </tt>

    Of course, the algorithm described in section&nbsp;IV can also be
    applied to prevent the sliding dot problem if one wants to.


    <a name="section-4">
    <h3>
      4. Right-to-left layout
    </h3>

    <p>The process of laying out Arabic or Hebrew text is extremely similar.
    The only difference is that the pen position must be decremented before
    the glyph rendering (remember: the advance width is always positive,
    even for Arabic glyphs).</p>

    <p>Right-to-left algorithm&nbsp;1:</p>

    <tt>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Convert the character string into a series of glyph
          indices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the pen to the cursor position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get or load the glyph image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decrement the pen position by the glyph's advance width in pixels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translate the glyph so that its "origin" matches the pen position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Render the glyph to the target device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start over at step&nbsp;3 for each of the remaining glyphs.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </tt>

    <p>The changes to algorithm&nbsp;2, as well as the inclusion of kerning
    are left as an exercise to the reader.</p>


    <a name="section-5">
    <h3>
      5. Vertical layouts
    </h3>

    <p>Laying out vertical text uses exactly the same processes, with the
    following significant differences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The baseline is vertical, and the vertical metrics must be used
        instead of the horizontal one.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The left bearing is usually negative, but this doesn't change the
        fact that the glyph origin must be located on the baseline.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        The advance height is always positive, so the pen position must be
        decremented if one wants to write top to bottom (assuming the
        <i>Y</i>&nbsp;axis is oriented upwards).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here the algorithm:</p>

    <tt>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Convert the character string into a series of glyph
          indices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the pen to the cursor position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get or load the glyph image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translate the glyph so that its "origin" matches the pen position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Render the glyph to the target device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decrement the vertical pen position by the glyph's advance height
          in pixels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start over at step&nbsp;3 for each of the remaining glyphs.
        </li>
        <li>
          When all glyphs are done, set the text cursor to the new pen
          position.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </tt>

    <h3>
      6. WYSIWYG text layouts
    </h3>

    <p>As you probably know, the acronym WYSIWYG stands for "What You See Is
    What You Get".  Basically, this means that the output of a document on
    the screen should match "perfectly" its printed version.  A
    <em>true</em> WYSIWYG system requires two things:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><em>device-independent text layout</em></p>

        <p>This means that the document's formatting is the same on the
        screen than on any printed output, including line breaks,
        justification, ligatures, fonts, position of inline images, etc.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>matching display and print character sizes</em></p>

        <p>The displayed size of a given character should match its
        dimensions when printed.  For example, a text string which is
        exactly 1&nbsp;inch tall when printed should also appear 1&nbsp;inch
        tall on the screen (when using a scale of 100%).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is clear that matching sizes cannot be possible if the computer
    has no knowledge of the physical resolutions of the display device(s) it
    is using.  And of course, this is the most common case!  That is not too
    unfortunate, however, because most users really don't care about this
    feature.  Legibility is much more important.</p>

    <p>When the Mac appeared, Apple decided to choose a resolution of
    72&nbsp;dpi to describe the Macintosh screen to the font sub-system
    (whatever the monitor used).  This choice was most probably driven by
    the fact that, at this resolution, 1&nbsp;point equals exactly
    1&nbsp;pixel.  However, it neglected one crucial fact: As most users
    tend to choose a document character size between 10 and 14&nbsp;points,
    the resultant displayed text was rather small and not too legible
    without scaling.  Microsoft engineers took notice of this problem and
    chose a resolution of 96&nbsp;dpi on Windows, which resulted in slightly
    larger, and more legible, displayed characters (for the same printed
    text size).</p>

    <p>These distinct resolutions explain some differences when displaying
    text at the same character size on a Mac and a Windows machine.
    Moreover, it is not unusual to find some TrueType fonts with enhanced
    hinting (technical note: through delta-hinting) for the sizes of 10, 12,
    14 and 16&nbsp;points at 96&nbsp;dpi.</p>

    <p>The term <em>device-independent text</em> is, unfortunately, often
    abused.  For example, many word processors, including MS&nbsp;Word, do
    not really use device-independent glyph positioning algorithms when
    laying out text.  Rather, they use the target printer's resolution to
    compute <em>hinted</em> glyph metrics for the layout.  Though it
    guarantees that the printed version is always the "nicest" it can be,
    especially for very low resolution printers (like dot-matrix), it has a
    very sad effect: Changing the printer can have dramatic effects on the
    <em>whole</em> document layout, especially if it makes strong use of
    justification, uses few page breaks, etc.</p>

    <p>Because glyph metrics vary slightly when the resolution changes (due
    to hinting), line breaks can change enormously, when these differences
    accumulate over long runs of text.  Try for example printing a very long
    document (with no page breaks) on a 300&nbsp;dpi ink-jet printer, then
    the same one on a 3000&nbsp;dpi laser printer: You will be extremely
    lucky if your final page count didn't change between the prints! Of
    course, we can still call this WYSIWYG, as long as the printer
    resolution is fixed.</p>

    <p>Some applications, like Adobe Acrobat, which targeted
    device-independent placement from the start, do not suffer from this
    problem.  There are two ways to achieve this: either use the scaled and
    unhinted glyph metrics when laying out text both in the rendering and
    printing processes, or simply use whatever metrics you want and store
    them with the text in order to get sure they are printed the same on all
    devices (the latter being probably the best solution, as it also enables
    font substitution without breaking text layouts).</p>

    <p>Just like matching sizes, device-independent placement isn't
    necessarily a feature that most users want.  However, it is pretty clear
    that for any kind of professional document processing work, it
    <em>is</em> a requirement.</p>
