Version 1.1.1 - 2006-11-30

The "xcompmgr is hard, let's go releasing" release

* Fix Bug #9154 and friends, to unbreak xcompmgr:
  Always process an event for _XReadEvents, even if an error occurs.
  Previously, process_responses (in the wait_for_first_event case called
  from _XReadEvents) considered any return from xcb_wait_for_event
  sufficient to think it had processed an event. If xcb_wait_for_event
  returned an error, and no more events occurred before process_responses
  called xcb_poll_for_event, process_responses would try to return with
  dpy->head NULL, and would fail an assertion for the _XReadEvents
  postcondition. Now, process_responses continues using xcb_wait_for_event
  until it gets an event.

* Bug #9153: Fix access to freed memory.
  The fix for bug #8622 introduced a smaller bug where _XReply would
  read memory shortly after freeing it. This patch caches the needed
  value in a stack-allocated variable before the heap-allocated memory
  is freed.

* libx11 doesn't use inputproto in public headers; don't require it in x11.pc.
  Based on a Debian patch.

* Debian bug #354315: Clarify return value in XGetWindowAttributes man page.
  Patch by Debian user Ross Combs.


Version 1.1 - 2006-11-23

* Add note in man-page that XListFontsWithInfo is not thread-safe.  _XReply
  drops the Display lock, so the value of dpy->request may change before
  _XReply is called again.  Jamey Sharp discovered this by inspection a few
  years ago.

* Fix Bug #8622, by fixing the response processing order for threaded apps.
  process_responses (the common code for _XReply, _XReadEvents, and
  _XEventsQueued) now handles responses in order, by adding condition variables
  to the list of outstanding requests in dpy->xcb->pending_requests, and
  blocking on them when those requests should get processed, to allow _XReply
  to process them; if actually called from _XReply, it returns when _XReply's
  request should get processed.  _XReply broadcasts on its condition variable
  after it has read its reply and re-acquired the display lock.

* Don't hold the display lock around callbacks to the application. This avoids
  recursive locking of the display lock (which triggers an XCB locking
  assertion), particularly with emacs.

* Add xcb-xlib dependency to x11.pc when built against XCB.

* Allocate the right amount of memory for dpy->lock_fns.  Fixes a crash on
  startup with gdk.

Version 1.1 RC1 - 2006-10-06

This release includes the Xlib/XCB work, which uses XCB as the Xlib transport
layer, and allows a client to use both Xlib and XCB on the same connection.
This allows clients to transition from Xlib to XCB incrementally.

Clients which link only to libX11, and do not use XCB, should not notice any
differences in this release.  Clients desiring XCB interoperability should
additionally #include <X11/Xlib-xcb.h>, link to libX11-xcb, use
XGetXCBConnection(dpy) to obtain the underlying XCB connection, and then use
XCB functions directly on that connection.

Note that while a client can issue requests and handle their replies or errors
with either Xlib or XCB, only one can own and handle the event queue.  By
default, Xlib must own the event queue, for compatibility with legacy Xlib
clients.  Clients can use the function XSetEventQueueOwner immediately after
XOpenDisplay to let XCB own the event queue instead.  Clients may not call
this function after processing any responses, as this will potentially lose
responses.

We expect to have an RC2 release corresponding to the Xorg RC2 schedule, which
should include additional internal architecture enhancements, but no
user-visible changes.  1.0 final should match RC2.

Other smaller changes in this release:
* correct ChangeLog generation
* support running lint and sparse
* Autoconf 2.60
* fix man page for XUrgencyHint
* improve man pages for XGrabButton, XGrabKey, XGetWindowProperty
* new locales: as_IN.UTF-8, kn_IN.UTF-8, ml_IN.UTF-8, or_IN.UTF-8,
  te_IN.UTF-8, ur_IN.UTF-8
* on systems with both UNIXCONN and LOCALCONN, try unix if local fails
* fix sparse warnings
* ansify static functions
