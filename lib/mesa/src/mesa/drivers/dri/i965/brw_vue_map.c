/**
 * @file brw_vue_map.c
 *
 * This file computes the "VUE map" for a (non-fragment) shader stage, which
 * describes the layout of its output varyings.  The VUE map is used to match
 * outputs from one stage with the inputs of the next.
 *
 * Largely, varyings can be placed however we like - producers/consumers simply
 * have to agree on the layout.  However, there is also a "VUE Header" that
 * prescribes a fixed-layout for items that interact with fixed function
 * hardware, such as the clipper and rasterizer.
