 * do validation of memory accesses by the GPU commands.  If we were to store
 * our commands in BOs, we'd need to do uncached readback from them to do the
 * validation process, which is too expensive.  Instead, userspace accumulates
 * commands and associated state in plain memory, then the kernel copies the
 * data to its own address space, and then validates and stores it in a GPU
 * BO.
