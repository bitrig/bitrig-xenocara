.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xft\-config
reports information of interest to users and developers about the installed
version of the X FreeType library,
.BR Xft (3).
Depending on how it is invoked,
.B xft\-config
reports the installed version of Xft, the compiler and linker flags
that are required to successfully compile and link C (or C-compatible) code
that uses the library, and/or the directories used by the GNU Autotools to
install its files.
Note that if the system's installed version of Xft came from an OS vendor
or other third party, the actual location of its files may differ from
those reported by
.BR xft\-config .
The system adminstrator can also relocate Xft's files.
.PP
If invoked without any arguments,
.B xft\-config
will print a usage message on standard error and exit.
