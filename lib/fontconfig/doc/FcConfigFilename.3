.SH NAME
FcConfigFilename \- Find a config file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <fontconfig.h>
.sp
FcChar8 * FcConfigFilename (const FcChar8 *\fIname\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Given the specified external entity name, return the associated filename.
This provides applications a way to convert various configuration file
references into filename form.
.PP
A null or empty \fIname\fR indicates that the default configuration file should
be used; which file this references can be overridden with the
FC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.  Next, if the name starts with \fI~\fR, it
refers to a file in the current users home directory.  Otherwise if the name
doesn't start with '/', it refers to a file in the default configuration
directory; the built-in default directory can be overridden with the
FC_CONFIG_DIR environment variable.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
Fontconfig version 2.6.0
