.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <fontconfig.h>

\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Counts the number of Unicode chars in \fIlen\fR bytes of
\fIsrc\fR\&.  Bytes of \fIsrc\fR are
combined into 16-bit units according to \fIendian\fR\&.
Places that count in \fInchar\fR\&.
\fIwchar\fR contains 1, 2 or 4 depending on the number of
bytes needed to hold the largest unicode char counted.  The return value
indicates whether \fIstring\fR is a well-formed UTF16
string.
