@PURPOSE@	scan a font file
@DESC@
Scans a single file and adds all fonts found to <parameter>set</parameter>.
If <parameter>force</parameter> is FcTrue, then the file is scanned even if
associated information is found in <parameter>cache</parameter>.  If
<parameter>file</parameter> is a directory, it is added to
<parameter>dirs</parameter>. Whether fonts are found depends on fontconfig
policy as well as the current configuration. Internally, fontconfig will
ignore BDF and PCF fonts which are not in Unicode (or the effectively
equivalent ISO Latin-1) encoding as those are not usable by Unicode-based
applications. The configuration can ignore fonts based on filename or
contents of the font file itself. Returns FcFalse if any of the fonts cannot be
added (due to allocation failure). Otherwise returns FcTrue.

@PURPOSE@	DEPRECATED: formerly used to scan a font directory
@DESC@
This function does nothing aside from returning FcFalse. It used to scan an
entire directory and add all fonts found to
<parameter>set</parameter>.  If <parameter>force</parameter> was FcTrue, then
the directory and all files within it were scanned even if information was
present in the per-directory cache file or <parameter>cache</parameter>. Any
subdirectories found were added to <parameter>dirs</parameter>.

@PURPOSE@	DEPRECATED: formerly used to save a directory cache
@DESC@
This function now does nothing aside from returning FcFalse. It used to creates the
per-directory cache file for <parameter>dir</parameter> and populates it
with the fonts in <parameter>set</parameter> and subdirectories in
<parameter>dirs</parameter>. All of this functionality is now automatically
managed by FcDirCacheLoad and FcDirCacheRead.
