.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <fontconfig.h>
.sp
FcBool FcDirScan (FcFontSet *\fIset\fB, FcStrSet *\fIdirs\fB, FcFileCache *\fIcache\fB, FcBlanks *\fIblanks\fB, const FcChar8 *\fIdir\fB, FcBool \fIforce\fB);

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function does nothing aside from returning FcFalse. It used to scan an
entire directory and add all fonts found to
\fIset\fR\&.  If \fIforce\fR was FcTrue, then
the directory and all files within it were scanned even if information was
present in the per-directory cache file or \fIcache\fR\&. Any
subdirectories found were added to \fIdirs\fR\&.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
Fontconfig version 2.6.0
