.SH NAME
FcDirSave \- DEPRECATED: formerly used to save a directory cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <fontconfig.h>
.sp
FcBool FcDirSave (FcFontSet *\fIset\fB, FcStrSet *\fIdirs\fB, const FcChar8 *\fIdir\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function now does nothing aside from returning FcFalse. It used to creates the
per-directory cache file for \fIdir\fR and populates it
with the fonts in \fIset\fR and subdirectories in
\fIdirs\fR\&. All of this functionality is now automatically
managed by FcDirCacheLoad and FcDirCacheRead.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
Fontconfig version 2.6.0
