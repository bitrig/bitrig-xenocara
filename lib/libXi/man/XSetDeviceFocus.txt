                    int * time_return);

Arguments

   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   device
          Specifies the device whose focus is to be queried or
          changed.

   focus
          Specifies the window, PointerRoot, FollowKeyboard,or
          None.

   focus_return
          Returns the focus window, PointerRoot, FollowKeyboard,or
          None.

   revert_to
          Specifies where the input focus reverts to if the window
          becomes notviewable.You can pass RevertToParent,
          RevertToPointerRoot, RevertToFollowKeyboard,or
          RevertToNone.

   revert_to_return
          Returns the current focus state RevertToParent,
          RevertToPointerRoot, RevertToFollowKeyboard,or
          RevertToNone.

   time_return
          Returns the last_focus_time for the device.

   time
          Specifies the time.You can pass either a timestamp or
          CurrentTime.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XSetDeviceFocus request changes the focus of the specified
   device and its last-focus-change time. It has no effect if the
   specified time is earlier than the current last-focus-change
   time or is later than the current X server time. Otherwise, the
   last-focus-change time is set to the specified time CurrentTime
   is replaced by the current X server time). XSetDeviceFocus
   causes the X server to generate DeviceFocusIn and
   DeviceFocusOut events.

   Depending on the focus argument, the following occurs:
     * If focus is None , all device events are discarded until a
       new focus window is set, and the revert_to argument is
       ignored.
     * If focus is a window, it becomes the device's focus window.
       If a generated device event would normally be reported to
       this window or one of its inferiors, the event is reported
       as usual. Otherwise, the event is reported relative to the
       focus window.
     * If focus is PointerRoot, the focus window is dynamically
       taken to be the root window of whatever screen the pointer
       is on at each event from the specified device. In this
       case, the revert_to argument is ignored.
     * If focus is FollowKeyboard, the focus window is dynamically
       taken to be the window to which the X keyboard focus is set
       at each input event.

   The specified focus window must be viewable at the time
   XSetDeviceFocus is called, or a BadMatch error results. If the
   focus window later becomes not viewable, the X server evaluates
   the revert_to argument to determine the new focus window as
   follows:
     * If revert_to is RevertToParent, the focus reverts to the
       parent (or the closest viewable ancestor), and the new
       revert_to value is taken to be RevertToNone.
     * If revert_to is RevertToPointerRoot,
       RevertToFollowKeyboard, or RevertToNone, the focus reverts
       to PointerRoot, FollowKeyboard, or None, respectively.

   When the focus reverts, the X server generates DeviceFocusIn
   and DeviceFocusOut events, but the last-focus-change time is
   not affected.

   Input extension devices are not required to support the ability
   to be focused. Attempting to set the focus of a device that
   does not support this request will result in a BadMatch error.
   Whether or not given device can support this request can be
   determined by the information returned by XOpenDevice. For
   those devices that support focus, XOpenDevice will return an
   XInputClassInfo structure with the input_class field equal to
   the constant FocusClass (defined in the file XI.h).

   XSetDeviceFocus can generate BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue, and
   BadWindow errors.

   The XGetDeviceFocus request returns the focus window and the
   current focus state.

   Not all input extension devices can be focused. Attempting to
   query the focus state of a device that can't be focused results
   in a BadMatch error. A device that can be focused returns
   information for input Class Focus when an XOpenDevice request
   is made.

   XGetDeviceFocus can generate BadDevice, and BadMatch errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
          XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if the
          specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.

   BadValue
          Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
          accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
          specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
          argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
          set of alternatives can generate this error.

   BadWindow
          A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
          Window.

   BadMatch
          This error may occur if an XGetDeviceFocus or
          XSetDeviceFocus request was made specifying a device
          that the server implementation does not allow to be
          focused.
