   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   device
          Specifies the device that is to be grabbed or released

   button
          Specifies the device button that is to be grabbed or
          released or XIAnyButton.

   keycode
          Specifies the keycode that is to be grabbed or released
          or XIAnyKeycode.

   num_modifiers
          Number of elements in modifiers or modifiers_inout.

   modifiers
          Specifies the set of latched and base modifiers or
          XIAnyModifier to ungrab. The data type is for
          consistency with the respective grab request and the
          status code of the XIGrabModifiers struct is ignored.

   modifiers_inout
          Specifies the set of latched and base modifiers or
          XIAnyModifier to grab. Returns the modifiers that could
          not be grabbed and their error code.

   grab_window
          Specifies the grab window.

   owner_events
          Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the are
          to be reported as usual or reported with respect to the
          grab window.

   mask
          Specifies the event mask.

   grab_mode
          Specifies further processing of events from this device.
          You can pass XIGrabModeSync or XIGrabModeAsync.

   paired_device_mode
          Specifies further processing of events from the paired
          master device. You can pass XIGrabModeSync or
          XIGrabModeAsync. If deviceid specifies a floating slave
          device, this parameter is ignored.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode and XIGrabTouchBegin establish a passive
   grab. The modifier device for a button grab is the paired master device
   if deviceid specifies a master pointer. Otherwise, the modifier
   device is the device specified with deviceid. In the future,
   the device is actively grabbed (as for XIGrabDevice, the
   last-grab time is set to the time at which the button or keycode
   was pressed and the XI_ButtonPress or XI_KeyPress event is
   reported if all of the following conditions are true:
     * The device is not grabbed, and the specified button or
       keycode is logically pressed or a touch event occurs when the
       specified modifier keys are logically down on the modifier device
       and no other buttons or modifier keys are logically down.
     * Either the grab window is an ancestor of (or is) the focus
       window, OR the grab window is a descendent of the focus
       window and contains the device.
     * A passive grab on the same button/modifier combination does
       not exist on any ancestor of grab_window.

   The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
   XIGrabDevice. The active grab is terminated automatically when
   the logical state of the device has all buttons or keys
   released (independent of the logical state of the modifier
   keys).

   If the device is an attached slave device, the device is
   automatically detached from the master device when the grab
   activates and reattached to the same master device when the
   grab deactivates. If the master device is removed while the
   device is floating as a result of a grab, the device remains
   floating once the grab deactivates.

   Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by client
   applications) may lag the physical state if device event
   processing is frozen.

   This request overrides all previous grabs by the same client on
   the same button/modifier or keycode/modifier combinations on the
   same window. A modifiers of XIAnyModifier is equivalent to
   issuing the grab request for all possible modifier combinations
   (including the combination of no modifiers). It is not required
   that all modifiers specified have currently assigned KeyCodes.
   A button of XIAnyButton is equivalent to issuing the request
   for all possible buttons. Otherwise, it is not required that
   the specified button currently be assigned to a physical
   button.

   If some other client has already issued a XIGrabButton or
   XIGrabKeycode with the same button/modifier or keycode/modifier
   combination on the same window, a BadAccess error results. When
   using XIAnyModifier or XIAnyButton , the request fails
   completely, and a XIBadAccess error results (no grabs are
   established) if there is a conflicting grab for any
   combination. XIGrabButton and XIGrabKeycode have no effect on an
   active grab.

   On success, XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode and XIGrabTouchBegin return 0;
   If one or more modifier combinations could not be grabbed,
   XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode and XIGrabTouchBegin return the number of
   failed combinations and modifiers_inout contains the failed combinations
   and their respective error codes.

   XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode and XIGrabTouchBegin can generate BadClass,
   BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

   XIUngrabButton, XIUngrabKeycode and XIUngrabTouchBegin release the
   passive grab for a button/modifier, keycode/modifier or touch/modifier
   combination on the specified window if it was grabbed by this client. A
   modifier of XIAnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the ungrab request
   for all possible modifier combinations, including the
   combination of no modifiers. A button of XIAnyButton is
   equivalent to issuing the request for all possible buttons.
   XIUngrabButton and XIUngrabKeycode have no effect on an active
   grab.

   XIUngrabButton, XIUngrabKeycode and XIUngrabTouchBegin can generate
   BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue and BadWindow errors.

RETURN VALUE
------------
   XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode and XIGrabTouchBegin return the number of
   modifier combination that could not establish a passive grab. The
   modifiers are returned in modifiers_inout, along with the respective
   error for this modifier combination. If XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode
   or XIGrabTouchBegin return zero, passive grabs with all requested
   modifier combinations were established successfully.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid deviceid was specified.

   BadMatch
          This error may occur if XIGrabButton specified a device
          that has no buttons, or XIGrabKeycode specified a device
          that has no keys, or XIGrabTouchBegin specified a device
          that is not touch-capable.

   BadValue
          Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
          accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
          specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
          argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
          set of alternatives can generate this error.

   BadWindow
          A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
          Window.

BUGS
----

   The protocol headers for XI 2.0 did not provide
   XIGrabModeAsync or XIGrabModeSync. Use GrabModeSync and
   GrabModeAsync instead, respectively.
