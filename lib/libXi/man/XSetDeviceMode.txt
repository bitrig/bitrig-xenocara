   devices are capable of reporting motion data, and not all are
   capable of changing modes from Absolute to Relative.

   XSetDeviceMode can generate a BadDevice or BadMode error.

DIAGNOSTICS

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
          XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if some
          other client has caused the specified device to become
          the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
          XChangeKeyboardDevice or XChangePointerDevice requests.

   BadMatch
          This error may occur if an XSetDeviceMode request is
          made specifying a device that has no valuators and
          reports no axes of motion.

   BadMode
          An invalid mode was specified. This error will also be
          returned if the specified device is not capable of
          supporting the XSetDeviceMode request.
