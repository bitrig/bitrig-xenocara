NAME
----

   XChangePointerDevice - change which device is the X pointer

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput.h>

   Status XChangePointerDevice( Display *display,
                                XDevice *device,
                                int xaxis,
                                int yaxis);

   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   device
          Specifies the device to be used as the X pointer.

   xaxis
          Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X
          pointer x-axis.

   yaxis
          Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X
          pointer y-axis.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XChangePointerDevice request causes the server to use the
   specified device as the X pointer. The device must have been
   opened by the client via XOpenDevice or a BadDevice error will
   result. The device must support input class Valuators or a
   BadMatch error will result. If the implementation does not
   support use of the specified device as the X pointer, a
   BadDevice error will result.

   If the specified device is grabbed by another client,
   AlreadyGrabbed is returned. If the specified device is frozen
   by a grab on another device, GrabFrozen is returned. If the
   request is successful, Success is returned.

   If the request succeeds, a ChangeDeviceNotify event is sent to
   all clients that have selected that event. A MappingNotify
   event with request = MappingPointer is sent to all clients. The
   specified device becomes the X pointer, and the old X pointer
   becomes accessible through the input extension protocol
   requests.

   XChangePointerDevice can generate a BadDevice or a BadMatch
   error.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist, has not been opened by this client via
          XOpenInputDevice, or is already one of the core X input
          devices (pointer or keyboard). This error may also occur
          if the server implementation does not support using the
          specified device as the X pointer.

   BadMatch
          This error may occur if an XChangePointerDevice request
          was made specifying a device that has less than two
          valuators, or specifying a valuator index beyond the
          range supported by the device.
