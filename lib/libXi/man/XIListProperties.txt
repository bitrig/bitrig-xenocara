The XIListProperties function returns a list of the
properties associated with the input device specified with 
deviceid. Each device may have an arbitrary number of properties
attached, some of which were created by the driver and/or
server, others created by clients at runtime.

The client is expected to free the list of properties using
XFree.

XIListProperties can generate a BadDevice error.

        exist.
