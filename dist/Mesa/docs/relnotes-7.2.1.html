<H1>Mesa 7.2.1 Release Notes / (date tbd)</H1>

<p>
Mesa 7.2.1 is a stable release fixing bugs found in 7.2.
</p>
<p>
Mesa 7.2.1 implements the OpenGL 2.1 API, but the version reported by
glGetString(GL_VERSION) depends on the particular driver being used.
Some drivers don't support all the features required in OpenGL 2.1.
</p>
<p>
Note that this version of Mesa does not use the GEM memory manager.
The master branch of git uses GEM.
The prototype DRI2 code that was in 7.1 has also been removed.
</p>
<p>
DRM version 2.3.1 should be used with Mesa 7.2

<h2>New features</h2>

<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>glGetIntegerv(GL_DEPTH_CLEAR_VALUE) returned wrong value
<li>Fixed Linux static library builds
<li>Fixed out of bounds memory writes to depth textures (bug 17800).
<li>Fixed rare vertex color bug in software renderer
</ul>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
</ul>



<h2>To Do (someday) items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remove the MEMCPY() and _mesa_memcpy() wrappers and just use memcpy().
Probably do the same for malloc, calloc, etc.
The wrappers were useful in the past for memory debugging but now we
have valgrind.  Not worried about SunOS 4 support anymore either...
<li>Switch to freeglut
<li>Fix linux-glide target/driver.
<li>Improved lambda and derivative calculation for frag progs.
</ul>
