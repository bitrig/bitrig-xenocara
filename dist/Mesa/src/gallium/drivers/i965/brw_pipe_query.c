/** @file support for ARB_query_object
 *
 * ARB_query_object is implemented by using the PIPE_CONTROL command to stall
 * execution on the completion of previous depth tests, and write the
 * current PS_DEPTH_COUNT to a buffer object.
 *
 * We use before and after counts when drawing during a query so that
 * we don't pick up other clients' query data in ours.  To reduce overhead,
 * a single BO is used to record the query data for all active queries at
 * once.  This also gives us a simple bound on how much batchbuffer space is
 * required for handling queries, so that we can be sure that we won't
 * have to emit a batchbuffer without getting the ending PS_DEPTH_COUNT.
