Random list of problems with i915g:

- Check if PIPE_CAP_BLEND_EQUATION_SEPARATE work, the code is there.
  If not fix it! A simple task, good for beginners.

- Add support for PIPE_CAP_POINT_SPRITE either via the draw module or directly
  via the hardware, look at the classic driver, more advanced.

- What does this button do? Figure out LIS7 with regards to depth offset.

- Dies with BadDrawable on GLXFBconfig changes/destruction. Makes piglit totally
  unusable :( Upgrading xserver helped here, it doesn't crash anymore. Still
  broken, it doesn't update the viewport/get new buffers.

- Kills the chip in 3D_PRIMITIVE LINELIST with mesa-demos/fbotexture in
  wireframe mode. Changing the cullmode to cw from none mitigates the crash. As
  does emitting only one line segment (2 indices) per 3D_PRIMITIVE command in
  the batch.

- Y-tiling is even more fun. i915c doesn't use it, maybe there's a reason?
  Texture sampling from Y-tiled buffers seems to work, though (save above
  problems).
  RESOLVED: Y-tiling works with the render engine, but not with the blitter.
  Use u_blitter and hw clears (PRIM3D_CLEAR_RECT).

- src/xvmc/i915_structs.h in xf86-video-intel has a few more bits of various
  commands defined. Scavenge them and see what's useful.
