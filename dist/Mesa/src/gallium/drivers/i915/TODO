Random list of problems with i915g:

- Dies with BadDrawable on GLXFBconfig changes/destruction. Makes piglit totally
  unusable :( Upgrading xserver helped here, it doesn't crash anymore. Still
  broken, it doesn't update the viewport/get new buffers.

- Tends to hang the chip after a few minutes of openarena. Looks tiling related,
  at the last frame rendered has tiling corruption over the complete frame.

- Kills the chip in 3D_PRIMITIVE LINELIST with mesa-demos/fbotexture in
  wireframe mode.

- Tiling is funny: If unlucky, it renders/samples all black. No clue yet what's
  going on. Seems to depend on tiny details like whethever the sampler
  relocation is fenced/unfenced (broken _with_ fenced reloc using tiling bits!).

- Y-tiling is even more fun. i915c doesn't use it, maybe there's a reason?
  Texture sampling from Y-tiled buffers seems to work, though (save above
  problems).

- Need to validate buffers before usage. Currently do_exec on the batchbuffer
  can fail with -ENOSPC.
