This directory contains Python bindings to Gallium3D. It looks like a state
tracker from the pipe driver perspective, and it looks like a pipe driver from
the python script perspective.


To build you'll need:
* Python (with development packages)
* SCons
* SWIG, http://www.swig.org/download.html
* Python Imaging Library with TK support, http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/, 
  for the samples

On a debian-based distro you can simply do:

  aptitude install python-dev scons swig python-imaging python-imaging-tk

On a Windows machine ensure the swig command is in your PATH.

Invoke scons on the top dir as
 
  scons debug=yes statetrackers=python drivers=softpipe winsys=none

To use it set PYTHONPATH appropriately, e.g, in Linux do:

  export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/build/linux-x86-debug/gallium/state_trackers/python

or (in Windows)

  set PYTHONPATH=%CD%\build\windows-x86-debug\gallium\state_trackers\python

and then try running

  python progs/gallium/python/samples/tri.py

which should show a triangle.


This is still work in progress:
- errors are not handled properly and almost always result in crash
- state atoms with array members are awkward to set
