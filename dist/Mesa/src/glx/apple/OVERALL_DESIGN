A lot of the code is automatically generated.

The following are generated based on specs/gl.spec and specs/enum.spec (from OpenGL.org):

apple_xgl_api.h
apple_xgl_api.c
exports.list
include/GL/gl.h 
include/GL/glext.h (includes the OpenGL framework glext.h)

The gen_code.tcl script is what executes the various gen_*.tcl scripts to produce those.

You will need Tcl 8.5 for the gen_code.tcl script.

The tests/ directory contains some tests that are built in testbuilds.

The tests built in testbuilds don't require installation of the library.
