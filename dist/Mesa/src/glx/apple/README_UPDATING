The design of most of this code is such that we extend the GLX structures 
with a void * named apple.

The GLX functions that need to do Apple-specific things are passed 
&s->apple in order to initialize the private structures.

Thus when updating, just run a diff against glxext.c or glxcmds.c, and
manually merge from there as needed.
