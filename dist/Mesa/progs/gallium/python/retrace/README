This is an application written in python to replay the traces captured by the
 trace pipe driver. 


To use it follow the instructions in src/gallium/drivers/trace/README and
src/gallium/state_trackers/python/README, and then do

  python src/gallium/state_trackers/python/samples/retrace/interpreter.py filename.trace


This is still work in progress:
- not everything is captured/replayed
  - surface/textures contents
- any tiny error will result in a crash
