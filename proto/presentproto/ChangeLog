    Clarify when pixmaps are assured of being idle
    
    Pixmaps will definitely be idle after the next PresentPixmap operation
    completes; the original text was vague about whether it was the
    execution of the request or the completion of the operation.

    PresentRegion->PresentPixmap, define options, add UST mode
    
    Changes the name of the PresentPixmap request from PresentRegion in
    anticipation of future additions of non-pixmap sourced updates (YUV
    images in particular).
    
    Adds definitions for all of the new PresentPixmap options.
    
    Adds PresentQueryCapabilities to provide applications the ability to
    learn what the underlying hardware can support. One requirement for
    any capability is that the X server must do something sensible even if
    the client behaves as if a capability is supported when it is not.
    
    Adds IdleNotify events. As pixmaps can go idle in any order, it's
    important for applications to know which pixmap to use next. We cannot
    use fences as the fence itself may not be signaled for some time after
    the X server has figured out which pixmap to idle.
    
    Note that the encoding and header files are not entirely up to date now.

    Remove SBC, use CompleteNotify for both Region and NotifyMSC
    
    SBC is entire a client-side notion, so remove it from the protocol.
    No need to have two events with the same content, but we do need to
    tell which request generated the event so stick a new field in some
    spare bytes
